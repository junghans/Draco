2005-01-12  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* config/ac_platforms.m4 (AC_DBS_LAHEY_ENVIRONMENT): Created a new
	m4 function that will modify the RPATH and LIBS environment
	variables by appending the Lahey lib directory.  Additionally, the
	Lahey compiler libraries are appended to LIBS.  RPATH and LIBS are
	only modified for components that require the Lahey libraries at
	link time (cdi_eospac and trilinos).  

	* src/configure.ac (Level 3): Removed cdi_eospac from list of
	packages to build and test because EOSPAC-5.35 is not fully
	compatible with Lahey 6.2.  See SF tracker at
	https://sourceforge-web.lanl.gov/tracker/?aid=4566. 

2004-12-02  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* draco: Released draco-5_3_0.  This is a minor draco release.  A
	summary of changes are:

	- autodoc: Recent mods look for dcc files in the top level autodoc
	  direcotry.
	- elisp: some small changes to improve font lock for DbC keywords.
        - c4: new broadcast signatures.
	- ds++: extensions to RCF and addition of File_Streams class.
	- quadrature: finished addition of QuadServices class.  New
  	  dependance on vendor GSL. Mods to build system were also made to
	  provide GSL as a draco vendor.
	- viz: switched to ensight gold format; added write_part() member
	  function. 
	- tools: added launchtest as an installed tool to improve
	  mpirun compatibility on lambda.
	
	This draco release includes the following packages:

		RTT_Format_Reader 
		c4
		cdi 
		cdi_analytic 
		cdi_gandolf 
		ds++ 
		lapack_wrap
		meshReaders
		meshReaders_Services
		mesh_element
		plot2D
		quadrature
		rng

	We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler issues
	have been resolved [hopefully with the release of a C version of
	EOSPAC].

	We are not releasing pcgWrap in draco until the pcgWrap component
        in Draco is updated to only call double precision routines.  The
        single precision routines in libpcg have been removed in recent
        versions. 

	We are not releaseing shared_lib in draco until this package
        passes its unit tests on QSC.

2004-11-10  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: Released draco-5_0_0.  See CCS-4:04-36 for details about
	the release.  This draco release includes the following component
	packages:

		RTT_Format_Reader
		c4

		traits
		units
		viz
		xm

	Note that imc and mc have been moved out of draco [to clubimc].
	Also, we have not released cdi_eospac as part of draco-5_0_0
	because of compiler issues involving EOSPAC.

	There are significant build system changes particularly with
	regard to the autodoc system [see CCS-4:04-25].  

	The Project Thuban [CCS-4:04-21] directory reorganization has been
	completed.  The draco development environment files have been
	moved to draco/environment.  Also, draco CVS now exists at
	sf.lanl.gov:/cvsroot/draco [draco SourceForge page].

	Again, see CCS-4:04-36 for details.

2004-04-19  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* src/*/autodoc/*: added autodoc/pkg.dcc to each draco package to
	conform to the new draco doxygenization system.

2004-04-13  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* src/Makefile.in: Because of upgrades to
	config/Makefile.dep.general, we can now do full parallel builds
	[including parallel dependency builds].

2004-04-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* mc, imc: Moved these packages to CLUBIMC library.  The last
	versions in draco were mc-4_0_0 and imc-4_0_0.  These tags were
	added just before the move.  Obviously, any history prior to these
	versions lives in draco, not clubimc. [Side Note: mc had one
	accidental commit to its ChangeLog after mc-4_0_0 tag.  This can
	be ignored].

2004-04-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: Moved to SourceForge CVS control.  Formal time of move:

		2004-04-06: 12:00 p.m.

		  these changes do not affect the package interface
		- imc has several changes; chief among these are full
		  surface tally integration
		- mc has the sphyramid mesh added
		- the units package has been redesigned
		- cdi_eospac now checks that the Lahey compiler is in the

2003-09-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: release draco-4_0_0. This is a major release with
	relatively minor changes from draco-3_2_0.  See
	draco/doc/releases/draco-4_0_0.tex for detail.	We are making this
	a major change because of the significant build system changes
	between draco-3_1_0 and draco-3_2_0.  In summary the changes are:

		- updates to mc and imc for random walk and surface
		  tracking
		- small build system improvements

2003-07-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: release draco-3_1_0.  This is a minor release that
	predates some [more] significant changes.  A summary of changes in
	this release is:

		- updated tests with return 0; statements in some packages
		- gray random walk implemented in imc package
		- surfaces added to mc package
		- small mods to c4 that returns the count after an async

		quadrature
		rng
		RTT_Format_Reader
		stdheaders
		timestep
		traits
		units
		viz
		xm

	Because this is a minor release we have not formally documented it
	with a release note. Also, we have not updated the code
	statistics. 

2003-06-04  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-3_0_0.	We have adopted some new policies,
	in particular, we now will not require package tags to be
	synchronized with the draco tag.  The package tags should be used
	for interim package releases [in between draco releases].  

	We will now be more proactive about documenting major draco
	releases.  As part of that spirit, see "Release of Draco-3_0_0" in
	draco/doc/releases/draco-3_0_0.tex for details of this release.

	The following packages are part of this release:
	
		c4 
		cdi
		cdi_analytic
		cdi_eospac 
		cdi_gandolf 
		ds++ 
		imc 
		lapack_wrap
		mc 
		meshReaders 
		meshReaders_Services
		pcgWrap 
		plot2D 
		quadrature 
		rng 
		RTT_Format_Reader 
		stdheaders
		timestep 
		traits 
		units 
		viz 
		xm 

	They all have draco-3_0_0 tags as their latest release.

	We will be releasing a new version of the "Draco Release Policy
	and Procedures" document to cover the new release policy.

	We will also be releasing a new version of the "The Draco Build
	System".  This release contains all build system updates
	documented in this file since draco-2_4_0.

2003-05-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco/config: updated to [hopefully] work correctly on the IBM
	platform.  I added platform-specific makefiles for dependency
	rules.	This is necesary because the IBM xlC compiler works goofy
	when it comes to dependencies.

2003-04-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco, draco/config: committed first set of changes to make the
	build system autoconf > 2.5 compliant.	This commit changed the
	following: 

		- Each directory now has its own aclocal.m4 [generated by
		automake] and configure [generated by autoconf].  Both of
		these files are stored in cvs.

		- The configure.in's have been replaced by configure.ac's
		matching the autoconf manual spec.

		- We updated some configure macros, particularly those
		that determined the word-sizes.	 Vendor defines are no
		done in a body at the end of AC_DRACO_ENV.  This
		necessitates adding the vendor defines to the
		AC_VENDOR_DEFINES macro.

		- We added all the variable substitutions to the
		AC_DBS_VAR_SUBSTITUTIONS macro.

		- We will be releasing draco as an entity in the next
		release cycle.

		- Make no longer automatically checks the configure system
		as a dependency.  We have provided the targets gmake
		configure and gmake reconfigure to manually do this.

		- The draco_config script effectively replaces autoreconf
		for building configure infrastructure in the draco source
		directory.

	We will be releasing a technical note describing the build
	system updates.	 We will also update the draco release procedures
	document.  The draco build system doxygen page will also get
	updated.  

	We will continue to tweak this until draco-3_0_0.  This release
	will be the first draco release with the "new" build system.
	
2003-04-28  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco, draco/config: updated draco build system to use autoconf
	> 1.5.	This version of autoconf is NOT backward compatible with
	autoconf 2.1*.	This update results in many changes:

		- no longer will configure/build system stuff get
		automatically built during gmake; you can manually rebuild
		configure stuff with the new makefile targets gmake
		configure and gmake reconfigure

		- we will now start releasing draco under one tag, and we
		will not update each package tag to correspond with a
		draco tag.  Package tags are still valid; however, they do
		not have to be sync'd with a draco tag.	 The draco tag [or
		package] tag will signify the latest version of a package.

		- We are now storing aclocal.m4 and configure files in
		each package directory.

2003-03-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-2_4_0.	This release contains the
	following packages:

		c4-2_3_0
		cdi-1_3_0
		cdi_analytic-1_1_0
		cdi_eospac-1_2_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_3_0
		ds++-1_9_0
		imc-3_3_0
		lapack_wrap-1_0_0
		mc-3_3_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
		pcgWrap-1_2_0
		plot2D-1_1_0
		quadrature-1_2_0
		rng-1_6_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		stdheaders-1_3_0
		timestep-1_3_0
		traits-1_5_0
		units-1_3_0
		viz-1_3_0
		xm-1_5_0

	See package ChangeLogs for package details.  On the draco front we
	changed:
		
		1) better doxygen front page
		2) build-system documentation
		3) new improved templates
		4) small build system fixes [Compaq link options]
		5) moved draco/Merge and draco/assesment to 
		   draco/doc/merge and draco/doc/assessment

	Made significant update to build system.  The libraries are now
	built prefixed by a rtt_ by default.  For example, the ds++
	package library will be:

		librtt_ds++.a(so)

	Everything else is the same.  The prefix is added to the Makefiles
	at configure time.  Packages are still referenced by their package
	name, not library name.	 The prefix can be changed by the
	--with-lib-prefix configure option.

	This change will help avoid library name collisions.  The
	following files were changed to accomodate the update:

		config/Makefile.package.in
		config/Makefile.test.in
		config/ac_conf.m4
		config/ac_draco_vendor.m4
		config/ac_dracoarg.m4
		config/ac_dracoenv.m4
		config/doc/build_system.dcc

2003-02-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* html: removed old John McGhee html info directory.

	* stopwatch: retired stopwatch package (corresponded to
	stopwatch-1_2_0). 

2002-12-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-2_3_0.	This release contains the
	following updates to packages:

		c4-2_2_0
		cdi-1_3_0 
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		cdi_eospac-1_2_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_3_0

		quadrature-1_2_0
		rng-1_6_0 
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0

		traits-1_5_0
		units-1_3_0
		viz-1_3_0 
		xm-1_5_0

		radphys-retired (no longer part of head)

	Mainly small fixes.

2002-12-10  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* radphys: Retired radphys (corresponded to radphys-1_5_0).  This
	package simply was not standard compliant.

2002-11-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-2_2_0.	This release includes the
	following packages:
	
		c4-2_2_0
		cdi-1_2_0
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		cdi_eospac-1_1_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
		ds++-1_7_0
		imc-3_2_0 
		lapack_wrap-1_0_0 
		mc-3_2_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0	    
		pcgWrap-1_1_0
		plot2D-1_1_0
		quadrature-1_1_0
		radphys-1_5_0
		rng-1_6_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		stdheaders-1_3_0
		stopwatch-1_2_0 
		timestep-1_3_0
		traits-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0 
		viz-1_3_0
		xm-1_4_0

	This release mainly has fixes for standard-compliant compiler
	stuff.	Very minor release, but it does seem to run on all
	systems.  The standard compliant fixes are for gcc 3.2.

2002-09-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* lapack_wrap: Added lapack_wrap component that provides
	C++-wrapped BLAS and LAPACK functions.

2002-08-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-2_1_0.	It includes the following
	packages:

		ds++-1_6_0
		stdheaders-1_2_0
		c4-2_1_0
		traits-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0
		xm-1_3_0
		rng-1_6_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		cdi-1_2_0
		quadrature-1_1_0
		stopwatch-1_2_0
		plot2D-1_0_0
		timestep-1_3_0
		pcgWrap-1_1_0
		viz-1_3_0
		radphys-1_4_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
		cdi_eospac-1_1_0
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		mc-3_1_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
		imc-3_1_0

	This is a minor draco release.	Most of the packages have been
	tested with the COMPAQ 6_5_0 compiler (all packages used by IMC
	codes).	 Some build system updates were added: principally, draco
	can now be used as a vendor by clients using the draco build
	system.	 It also has expanded COMPAQ support.

	We still have the following to work on:
		
		- support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
		  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
		  must be able to be generated
		- better F90 integration
		- better documentation for draco build system

2002-05-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco: released draco-2_0_0.	The following packages no longer
	have their own tags:

		config
		tools
		templates

	The new policy is that only packages under draco/src have their
	own formal tags.  All other parts of draco simply carry a release
	tag.  This release of draco contains the following tagged
	packages:

		ds++-1_6_0
		stdheaders-1_2_0
		c4-2_0_0
		traits-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0
		xm-1_3_0
		rng-1_6_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		cdi-1_2_0
		quadrature-1_1_0
		stopwatch-1_2_0
		plot2D-1_0_0
		timestep-1_3_0
		pcgWrap-1_1_0
		viz-1_3_0
		radphys-1_4_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
		cdi_eospac-1_1_0
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		mc-3_0_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
		imc-3_0_0

	Pre-built versions of draco are available on
	/radtran/vendors/draco.	 This is a link that points to the latest
	release. 

	As of this release, all of draco is required to build with the g++
	(> 3.0.1) compiler.  This is, of course, subject to discussion;
	however, we will keep this as a general rule.  

	The build system has been significantly updated:

		- real support for autodoc (doxygen)
		- cleaned up compiler and vendor support
		- support cxx, gcc, kcc, and SGI CC compilers
		- improved support for F90

	We still have the following to work on:
		
		- support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
		  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
		  must be able to be generated
		- better F90 integration
		- better documentation for draco build system

	To figure out the parameters of a draco build, use the bin/draco
	tool.  This script will tell the following info:

		- version of draco
		- configure options used in build
		- installation prefix

	As implied above, it gets installed inside of bin. Use draco
	--help to query options.

	* doc/design: added draco levelization diagrams reflecting current
	version of draco.

	* src/configure.in: updated this configure.in to reflect the
	current state of draco.

	* draco: on this date--between release 1_0_0 and 2_0_0--draco has
	the following packages:

		level 1: ds++ stdheaders
		level 2: xm rng c4 units traits UnitTestFrame cdi
		level 3: timestep pcgWrap stopwatch quadrature radphys
			 ConjGrad meshReaders viz cdi_eospac 
			 cdi_gandolf cdi_analytic
		level 4: RTT_Format_Reader
		level 5: mc meshReaders_Services
		level 6: imc

	* pcgWrap: changed linalg to pcgWrap.  Released pcgWrap-1_0_0.
	This is a temporary package because pcg is no longer supported at
	the lab.  It will be superceded in the near future.

	* config: build-system improvements.  Notably, cleaned up vendor
	stuff--added with-lapack, with-gandolf, with-pcg, removed
	with-pcglib.

	* templates: update templates to 1_1_0, added ChangeLog file to
	templates directory.  In the future, each package in draco that
	maintains its own numbered release tag, autodoc, templates,
	config, c4, ds++, etc. should have their own ChangeLog files to
	record package-wide changes.  The draco ChangeLog will only record 
	draco-specific changes, releases, etc.	Of course, developers
	should feel free to "mirror" any changes noted in the individual
	package ChangeLogs to the draco ChangeLogs.  Even comments such
	as, "made changes in templates" are effective, as a user could
	simply peruse the templates ChangeLog file to see actual changes
	made. 

1999-09-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
	document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
	to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
	documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
	gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
	Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
	and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
	target yet.

	* src (all directories): initial release.
