	* autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
	document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
	to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
	documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
	gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
	Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
	and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
	target yet.
