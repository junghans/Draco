	*  draco: Release draco-6_3_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-6_2_0
	  - milagro-5_4_0
	  - wedgehog-7_5_0
	  - capsaicin-3_2_0

	* Platforms:
	  YR/TU/HU/TY/LU Intel 12.1.2    OpenMPI-1.4.5
	  CT/CI          Intel 12.1.2    MPICH2-5.4.2
	  Roadrunner     GCC-4.3.0       OpenMPI-1.4.3

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 307 files where changed, added or removed in 292 commits.
	  - All releases will use Intel 12.1.2 and OpenMPI-1.4.5 or
	    MPICH2-5.4.2 (CT/CI) except Roadrunner.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Improved detection and setup of MPI libraries, flags, MPIEXEC,
  	    etc.
	  - Turn on OpenMP support by default for all compilers sans PGI.
	  - Nightly regressions added for OSX (mistress).
	  - Improve auto-detection of CUDA and CUDA compiler flag setup.
	  - Improved determination of HOST_NAME_MAX for OSX.
	  - No longer support ATLAS version of LAPACK.  Require the use of
	    lapack-3.4.0 or later.
	  - Discovered an issue with PGI zero-cost exception handeling
	    which is turned on by default in version 11+.  Initially added
	    the --nozc_eh flag for PGI to avoid using this feature of the
	    compiler.  Later we determined that newer PGI versions are
	    fundamentally broken and decided to only support Intel and
	    GCC.
	  - Improved build support for CT/CI including support for
	    building w/o a toolchain file.

	Developer Environment:
	  - Provide an updated memo for "Draco Release Policy and
	    Procedures."
	  - Change default module for Bullseye Coverage to 8.4.12.
	  - Provide SVN 1.6.17 on ICN platforms and version 1.7.2 to the
	    CCS LAN.
	  - Provide a presentation of how CMake is used by Draco (talk
	    given to the SWIFT team).
	  - Update Emacs setup scripts so that F9 starts the psvn wrapper
	    for SVN.
	  - Remove module setup files for older software (cmake-2.8.1,
  	    gcc-4.4.4, etc.)
	  - Provide an updated Draco Release Policy document.
	  - Update gettingStarted document and then merge it into an
  	    updated Draco Build System document.
	  - Retired a lot of documents and scripts that are deprecated by
	    the CMake-based build system.
	  - On the CCS LAN, remove module binary and setup from Draco
	    sources.  It is now located at /ccs/codes/radtran/vendors/...

	c4:
	  - In Timer, provide improved support for PAPI instrumentation.
	  - ApplicationUnitTest was updated to optionally provide wall
	    clock times for individual tests.
	  - ApplicationUnitTest updated to support 'aprun' on CT/CI.  This
	    includes modifying the add_application_test() cmake macro so
	    that it only runs from the 'login' and knows how to run under
	    aprun.

	cdi_analytic:
	  - eliminate redundant code.
	  - Added tests to improve code coverage.
	  - Modify pseudo line spectrum model to use a damping rather than
	    Gauss profile. Use proper black body weights in band
	    averages. Allow for possibility some bands have negligible
	    energy in them. For example, the command

	   add_scalar_tests(
              SOURCES   "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tstApplicationUnitTest.cc"
	      DEPS      "Lib_dsxx"
	      TEST_ARGS "--np 2"
	      APPLICATION_UNIT_TEST )

	    will start the test c4/test/tstApplicationUnitTest "--np" "2"
	    from the login node.

	ds++:
	  - In SP, provide improved detection and reporting of casting
	    between incompatible pointer types.
	  - Provide new class SystemCall that provides functions like
	    draco_gethostname() and draco_getpid() and masks direct system
	    calls.
	  - Rework isFinite class so that Draco standard dependencies
	    between .hh, .i.hh, .cc and _pt.cc files exist.
	  - Added tests to improve code coverage.
	  - Added a new feature to Draco DBC that will print DBC messages
	    w/o throwing the associated exception from toss_cookies().
	    The new NOTHROW feature is enabled by setting the 4th bit of
	    DRACO_DBC_LEVEL (+8) and is meant for use in optimized code
	    where all DBC messages are desired w/o stopping the code.

	FortranChecks:
	  - This is a new draco component associated with making Fortran a
	    primary Draco language.  This component tests operatio of the
	    Fortran compiler and Fortran/C++ linkage.  It also provides
	    sample ISO_C_BINDING syntax.

	lapack_wrap:
	  - Implement CMake's FortranCInterface features to automatically
	    detect and use the correct Fortran/C name mangling.
	  - Eliminate the Blas_Level_1.hh file by moving all of it's
	    content into Blas.hh.  This is a minor change since the
	    previous Blas.hh only included the Blas_Level_1.hh header.
	  - Update the unit test so that it runs through all of the
	    wrapped blas routines for floats and doubles.  Previously, we
	    only tested the interfaces for doubles.

	parser:
	  - Fixed a memory leak discovered in Abstract_Class_Parser.
	  - Add unit testst to improve code coverage.
	  - Added tests to improve code coverage.

	quadrature:
	  - Produced static public interfaces to the algorithms underlying
	    the computeD, computeN and compute_N2lk private members of
	    QuadServices, so that these could be applied any arbitrary
	    quadrature. Used these new functions to greatly simplify the
	    OrdinateSet compute_moment_to_discrete_weights and
	    compute_discrete_to_moment_weights and permit them to work
	    properly for quadrature sets of one dimensionality pruned or
	    expanded to work in another dimensionality.

	RTT_Format_Reader:
	  - Added unit tests for improved coverage of main library.

	* Corrected defects:
	  - artf22444: Regression reports fail to post from Cielito.

	* Known defects:
	  - Known defects are listed on LANL's TeamForge web server,
	    tf.lanl.gov.  Here is a list of known defects:

	  - artf21614: Safe_Ptr has a design defect (This feature is not
	    currently used by Capsaicin or Jayenne).
	  - artf22544: c4/tstOMP fails on CT (This feature is not
	    currently used by Capsaicin or Jayenne).
          - artf20096: c4/tstComm_Dup fails for optimized builds on
	    Cielito.
	  - #93: Provide more checks for C++11 capabilities/features.

	* draco: Release draco-6_3_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-6_1_0
	  - milagro-5_3_0
	  - wedgehog-7_4_0
	  - capsaicin-3_1_0

	* Platforms:
	  TU/HU/TY   Intel 10.0.023   OpenMPI-1.4.3
	  HU/YR      PGI 9.0-3        OpenMPI-1.4.3

	  Roadrunner GCC-4.3.0        OpenMPI-1.4.3

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 227 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - This release does not include the package plot2D.
	  - pcgWrap and cdi_gandolf components have been retired.
	  - cdi_ipcress provides a drop in replacement for cdi_gandolf and
	    no longer requires libgandolf.
	  - Introduce CUDA support.
	  - Provide basic support for PAPI instrumentation.
	  - Provide basic support for OpenMP directives.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Require CMake-2.8.6 or later.
	  - Begin using FeatureSumamry.cmake.
	  - Revert to using CMake's version of FindBLAS and FindLAPACK
	    instead of rolling our own.
	  - Improve support for Apple OS/X builds (XCode).
	  - Modify FindGSL.cmake to use system provided libraries on
 	    CT/CU.
	  - Correct flags set for RELWITHDEBINFO build types.
	  - Make optimizations more aggressive for PGI.

	Developer Environment:
	  - Retire modules for null, gandolf and pcg as these are no longer
	    supported by Draco.
	  - On CCS LAN, add module options for gcc-4.6.2, cmake-2.8.6 (default),
	    cmake-2.8.7, git/1.7.7.2.
	  - On HPC, add module for cmake-2.8.6 (default), cmake-2.8.7
	  - When loading the gsl module, prefix LD_LIBRARY_PATH with
	    GSL_LIB_DIR.
	  - For RR3 and rr-dev, update path for atlas to point to
	    /usr/projects/draco/vendors/lapack/rr-openmpi143-gfortran430-gcc430
	    because /opt/Ptools/atlas/3.8.2 does not exist on RR3.
	  - Provide .bashrc support for drawin.lanl.gov (CCS-7 GPU
	    machine).
	  - On CT/CI, use vendor provlided GSL instead of the version
	    found at /usr/projects/draco/vendors.
	  - On TU/HU/TY, set FC=ifort (Intel Fortran).
	  - Provide a prototype .cshrc for HPC machines.
	  - Update elisp to treat *.cu (CUDA) files as C++ for
	    formatting purposes.
	  - Update newmemo.cls to eliminate a space from the Phone/FAX and
	    Symbol lines.
	  - Update regression scripts so they use /scratch instead of
	    /scratch3/ for HPC machines (/scratch3 is retired).
	  - Clean up the regression scripts for testing on CT.

	RTT_Format_Reader:
	  - Update unit tests to use ScalarUnitTest in place of
	    ParallelUnitTest.  This eliminates a needless dependency on
	    c4.

	c4:
	  - Provide a new rtt_c4 function: get_processor_name() that uses
	    MPI_Get_processor_name() if available or gethostname().
	  - Adding long long to c4, changing rn_stream to uint64.
	    Changing all references from uint64_t to unsigned long long in
	    c4.

            The reason for this is due to a standards clash best seen in
	    MPI_Traits.hh. Although we'd like to insist on uint64_t (ANSI
	    C 99), we are only guaranteed unsigned long long in the MPI
	    standard. So fundamentally we have to pass using the trait
	    from the following function in the MPI traits:

            template<>
            struct MPI_Traits<unsigned long long>
            {
               static MPI_Datatype element_type() {
	                 return MPI_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG; }
            };

            We can only rely on short <= int <= long <= long long --
	    hopefully int64_t fits into one of those boxes in a parallel
	    call.
	  - Provide support for T=vector<char> and T=std::string when
	    calling determinate_gatherv() or indeterminate_gatherv().  Add
	    unit tests for these new features.
	  - In C4_Req.hh, make a modification to eliminate a pervasive
	    "missing braces" warning.
	  - Move discovery of PAPI from CMakeLists.txt to
	    config/compilerEnv.cmake.
	  - Continue work started by Kent to provide support for PAPI
	    profiling. This commit modifies Kent's work by storing PAPI
	    build variables in the CMakeCache.txt.  Also, if PAPI is used,
	    all unit tests that need c4 will now also link against the
	    PAPI library.
	  - Bug fix:  A logic error would produce invalid set values in
	    c4/config.h if Draco was configured with default settings and
	    then DRACO_C4 was manually changed to SCALAR.  This change
	    makes SCALAR vs MPI settings exclusive.
	  - Processor_Group.cc modified to allow decomposition in energy
	    (Capsaicin) for Sn_Eigenvalue problems.
	  - Modify the Timer class so that PAPI data is printed (if PAPI
	    is available).
	  - Provide a wrapper for "omp.h." and define USE_OPENMP in
	    c4/config.h.
	  - Add unit test tstOMP.cc to demonstrate the use OpenMP
	    pragmas.

	cdi:
	  - Provide an additional enum value to distinguish between
	    cdi_gandolf and cdi_ipcress.

	cdi_analytic:
	  - In Analytic_Odfmg_Opacity.hh, remove some dead code that was
	    showing up in the code coverage analysis. This block of code
	    exists in nGray_Analytic_Odfmg_Opacity.hh. Due to inheritance
	    code design I don't think the copy found in
	    Analytic_Odfmg_Opacity.hh could be called.
	  - Remove redundant energy quadrature specification from opacity
	    model inputs. Get decomposition in energy working again.

	cdi_gandolf:
	  - Retired. Replaced with cdi_ipcress.

	cdi_ipcress:
	  - New component for Draco-6_3_0. Replaces cdi_gandolf for
	    reading IPCRESS files.  Does not require libgandolf.a.

	device:
	  - Provide a prototype GPU_Device class and unit test tests that
	    demonstrate the runtime and the device API for CUDA.
	  - Fix a build system logic error that was causing configure
	    failures on superflytnt.  This system has libcuda.so available
	    (triggering HAVE_CUDA=ON) but the full SDK (compiler, headers)
	    is not available.  Logic updated to ensure that both libcuda
	    and nvcc are available before trying to enable CUDA.
	  - Also add option USE_CUDA that can be set to OFF in cases where
	    the CUDA SDK is available, but the developer does not want to
	    use GPU code.
	  - In DACS_Device_Interface.cc, modify the signature of the
	    funciton pointer to avoid confusion between C and C++ linkage.
	    Here are the comments from DACS_Device_Interface.cc/hh:

            // The definition in the source file does not have extern "C"
	    // on it, but because it is the same f(int) as in the
	    // declaration in the header, the language rules state that
	    // the extern "C" from the declaration applies to it as
	    // well. The definition for f is thus generated with C
	    // linkage, that is, with the unmangled name
	    // "f". (www.glenmccl.com/ansi028.htm).

            // These functions will be generated with C linkage (no name
	    // mangling).  However, the function pointer will still be
	    // generated with C++ linkage in the .cc file and with C
	    // linkage in this file (according to the ANSI standard). This
	    // causes link errors with some compilers (PGI) because the
	    // function signatures in the .cc and .hh files do not match.
	    // The solution is to create and use a typdef for the extern
	    // function pointer signature.

	  - The GCC compiler makes assumptions about the function pointer
	    signature and will do 'the right thing' with either
	    implementation. Because this may come up again, I thought I
	    would go ahead and make these changes that document and
	    provide an example of the correct strict ANSI implimentation.

	ds++:
	  - In Endian.hh, added 2 new functions to rtt_dsxx namespace:

            bool is_big_endian(void)
            . Returns true if the current platform is a big endian machine
	      (powerpc).

            bool has_ieee_float_representation(void)
            . Returns true if the platform supports IEEE floating point
	      representation rules (some Cray machines do not)

	quadrature:
	  - In QuadServices.cc add some low-level services for converting
	    between moment and discrete representations and for converting
	    first-order moments to physical fluxes.

	rng:
	  - Adding long long to c4, changing rn_stream to uint64.

	Corrected defects from TeamForge Tracker:
	  - artf1836: cdi_gandof will SEGV if a bad key is provided.
	  - artf1868: Provide support for library prefix other than rtt_.

	Known defects:
	  - Known defects are listed on LANL's TeamForge web server,
	    tf.lanl.gov.  Here is a list of known defects:

	  - artf22444: Regression reports fail to post from CT.
	  - artf22544: c4/tstOMP fails on CT (This feature is not
	    currently used by Capsaicin or Jayenne).
	  - artf21614: Safe_Ptr has a design defect (This feature is not
	    currently used by Capsaicin or Jayenne).
          - artf20096: c4/tstComm_Dup fails for optimized builds on
	    Cielito.

	* draco: Release draco-6_2_1.  This is a patch Draco release.
	  Issues were discovered with the 6_2_0 release that prevented
  	  code from executing correctly on the RoadRunner SPU processors.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-6_0_1
	  - milagro-5_2_1
	  - wedgehog-7_3_1
	  - capsaicin

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 73 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - This release does not include the packages pcgWrap or plot2D.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - CMake will now try to identify a Fortran compiler.
	    Registering Fortran as an active languge in the project aids
	    in the discovery of BLAS and LAPACK.
	  - Retire some autoconf files.
	  - A few changes to how tests are registered on roadrunner (match
	    more system names).
          - Provides support for building non-het version of the code on
	    roadrunner.

	Environment:
	  - Retire Linux32 module support.
	  - Create a new grouping 'hpc' for generic tools that work on all
	    HPC machines (e.g.: cmake, numdiff, etc.)
	  - Provide better default settings for http_proxy.

	ds++:
	  - No longer build, test or install Safe_Ptr or DBC_Ptr (see
	    artf21614).
	  - Provide new function 'get_word_count' in UnitTest.  This is
	    useful for checking captured output from unit tests.

	Known defects:
	  - artf21614: Safe_Ptr has a design defect.
	  - artf1836:  cdi_gandolf will SEGV if bad key is provided.
	  - artf20096: c4/tstComm_Dup fails for optimized builds on
	    cielito.
	  - artf1845:  cdi_eospac tests fail to compile on Linux.
	  - artf20097: Unit tests fail when using pgCC 11+ (cielito).
	  - artf21276: Consider retiring plot2D, cdi_eospac, pcgWrap.

	Resolved defects:
	  - artf1868: Make vendor dependent library prefixes.

2011-08-02  Kelly (KT) Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* draco: Release draco-6_2_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-6_0_0
	  - milagro-5_2_0
	  - wedgehog-7_3_0
	  - capsaicin

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 540 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - This release does not include the packages pcgWrap or plot2D.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Support for autoconf is deprecated with this release.  CMake
	    will be the only supported build system.
	  - Provide a BUILD_DOCS option and the assoicated 'doc' Makefile
	    target that will compile LaTeX sources found in the doc
 	    subdirectory into pdf.
	  - Eliminate config/FindMPI.cmake in favor of using the version
	    provided with CMake-2.8.5.
	  - Provide better support for Eclipse CDT and XCode development
	    environments.
	  - No longer require GSL or LAPACK to configure draco with cmake
	    (some components will not be built if these libraries are
	    missing).
	  - Improved use of Valgrind for regressing testing and reporting.
	    The valgrind suppression file is located at
	    draco/regression/valgrind_suppress.txt.  Results are
	    summarized on the CCS-2 Dashboard.
          - Added use of RESOURCE_LOCK when registering tests to avoid
	    conflicts between tests.
          - Added use of RUN_AFTER when registering tests to associated a
	    dependence between two or more tests.
          - Merge changes in vendor supplied FindBLAS.cmake with our own
	    version.
          - Improve how FindBLAS.cmake works when Fortran is active.
          - Replace FindCPLAPACK.cmake with FindLAPACK.cmake.
          - Provide support for Cielito by providing a toolchain file
	    (config/Toolchain-catamount.cmake).
          - Provide support for Roadrunner by providing a toolchain file
	    (config/Toolchain-roadrunner-ppe.cmake).  More details at
	    https://tf.lanl.gov/sf/wiki/do/viewPage/projects.jayenne/wiki/HowToBuildLinux.
          - Provide support for running ctest for a PPE build when on the
	    RoadRunner backend.  In this mode, the tests are registered as
	    short scripts that ssh into a PPC node and executes the test
	    from the PPC.

	Developer Environment:
	  - The CDash dashboard at coder.lanl.gov/cdash is now the primary
	    point of information concerning regression testing/reporting.
	  - Several new styles have been added to the environment/latex
	    directory, including the beamer presentation templte.
	  - The modules capability has been expanded through the addition
	    of more module definition files: eclipse, bullseyecoverage,
	    gcc-4.5.2, intel-10.0.023, pgi-10.4, pgi-7.0-5, python-2.6.6,
	    trilinos-10.6.4, valgrind-3.6.1, etc.
	  - Component level Release files have been consolidated so that
	    only ds++/Release is used for Draco version information.
	  - Autoconf and SCons build system files are deprecated and will
	    be retired over the next few weeks.
	  - When using cmake-gui or ccmake, some variables are now
	    contrained to permittable values.

	c4:
	  - Redesign the ApplicationUnitTest class so that it uses the CPP
	    macro DRACO_UNAME instead of the deprecated C4_UNAME. Change
	    the CPP macros of the form c4_is<platform> to
	    draco_is<platform>. Finally, the define for C4_MPICMD has been
	    moved to c4/config.h and away from ApplicationUnitTest.hh.
          - Use the new functions from ds++/path.hh instead of redefining
	    our own in c4.
          - Update the ApplicationUnitTest class so that it works on
	    Cielito (i.e.: teach it to run aprun).
          - C4_Functions.hh defines a new function send_is that will
	    invoke MPI_Issend.
          - Update ParallelUnitTest to correct a deficiency that allowed
	    the test to report PASS when a failure only occured on a
	    non-IO processor.  Also eliminated a potential race condition
	    found in the status() member function.
          - Update Send_Receive so that the sender now holds onto size in
	    a private member variable.  This prevents the value from going
	    out of scope before the send completes.

            This resolves the failure of the single-PE
	    'auto-communication' test in tstSend_Receive on Cielito.  This
	    test has typically passed on other machines, probably due to
	    lucky buffering by MPI.  MPI_Isend will not block waiting for
	    a matching receive, but it's not required to buffer data.  The
	    send buffer can only be safely reused (or destroyed, by any
	    mechanism) after the send completes; i.e., after a Wait or
	    Test.

	cdi:
	  - In OpacityCommon.hh, provide a new enum value for
	    rtt_cdi::Reaction to indicate the end of the enumeration list.
	    This is uselful for default initialization.

	cdi_analytic:
	  - Changed Pseudo_Line_Analytic_Opacity to
	    Pseudo_Line_Analytic_MultigroupOpacity. This change supports
	    implementing ODF opacities and pseudo line opacities in
	    Serrano.
	  - Rename Analytic_Multigroup_Opacity to
	    nGray_Analytic_MultigroupOpacity. This change supports
	    implementing ODF opacities and pseudo line opacities in
	    Serrano.
	  - This component now depends on the parser and ode components,
	    moving it from level 3 to level 4 in the levelization
	    diagram.

	cdi_gandolf:
	  - Provide a new utility,GandolfInterpreter, that can read
	    IPCRESS files and interactively provide information about its
	    content.  An example use command is:

	   ./GandolfInterpreter file.ipcress

	   You can follow the prompts to query various parts of the IPCRESS file.
	  - GandolfWrapper was modified to change the maximum allowed
	    materials per file from 10 to 128.

	device:
	  - This component is new for Draco-6_2_0.  Its purpose is to
	    provide an interface/handle for a heterogeneous computing
	    device.  Currently, it wraps the DACS interface for
	    RoadRunner.  In the future it may also provide an interface to
	    GPUs or special threading models.
	  - Currently, this component is only available when building on
	    RoadRunner.
	  - DACS_Device is a singleton for DACS host-side resource and
	    process management.
	  - DACS_Process is an abstract host-side representation of an
	    accel-side process.  DACS_Process represents an accel-side
	    process.  It provides methods to start and stop the accel-side
	    process, and accessors that return the filename of the
	    accel-side binary and the pid of the running process.  Clients
	    should inherit from DACS_Process and implement the stop method.

	ds++:
	  - Retire Allocators.
	    In practice, this class was designed before the STL allocators
	    class was finalized and was deficient when compared to current
	    standards.  There are other design defects that caused
	    repeated compiler warnings. Also, the Allocators classes were
	    only being used by ds++/Mat.hh and this class was designed so
	    that only the Simple_Allocator would work. It was impossible
	    to instantiate Mat[1-5] with the Guarded_Allocator<T>.  The
	    plan is to update Mat.hh to use std::allocators<T>.  This
	    still allows more sophisticated allocators to be used in the
	    future and allow us to eliminate ds++/Allocators.hh.
	  - Retire DynArray.
	  - Update Mat classes to use STL allocators instead of
	    ds++/Allocators, which are being retired.
	  - Provide a new function verbose_error() in path.hh.
	  - Refactor UnitTest by moving some file/path manipulation logic
	    into ds++/path.hh.
	  - Update path by providing the member functions fileExists() and
	    getFilenameComponent().
	  - Provide swap.hh.  This class provides functions that do
	    byte-swapping in one of two ways: either use GNU extended asm
	    for x86 (really f86+), or use the poor people's method of
	    digging out one byte at a time and moving it to the right
	    place. The poor method is really not that bad: GCC for example
	    seems to optimize it down to about 5 instructions in the 32
	    bit case, including loads, versus 2 instructions (including
	    load) for the inline asm case.
	  - Establish Release.hh/cc as the Release information for all
	    Draco components.

	lapack_wrap:
	  - The build system will omit lapack_wrap from the build if
	    LAPACK is not found.

	linear:
	  - ludcmp.i.hh was modified to use abs from ds++ instead of
	    cstdlib.h. The dsxx version provides specialization for double
	    and eliminates a gcc warning when compiling on rr-dev.
	  - This component does not depend on traits so remove this
	    linkage from CMakeLists.txt.

	parser:
	  - Expanded initialization syntax for Expression to allow general
	    expressions.

	quadrature:
	  - In Angle_Operator, added a capability to choose to add an
	    additional set of starting directions which are zero-weight,
	    outwardly directed angles on a level that are opposite the
	    inwardly directed angles usually used for the starting
	    direction calculation in curvilinear coordinates.

            The enforce exact symmetry flag for the sweeper is now a bool
	    and is set to be false by default. This change requires that
	    many of the application test input files be modified to turn
	    this flat on because the base files were calculated with the
	    previous default of being turned on.

	  - In Angle_Operator, added a vector<unsigned> data member and
	    accessor that contains the angle index into the most-positive
	    outwardly directed angle on every level for ordinate sets
	    constructed for curvilinear coordinates.  These are the angles
	    used to reflect the starting direction angular fluxes.
	  - Updated Ordinate so that the ordinates can be sorted based on
	    a comparator supplied to the QuadServices constructor.  Also
	    fixed an inconsistency in ordering of ordinates. Fix incorrect
	    multiplication of source by opacity. Now returns constant
	    solution for S6 and source boundaries.
	  - Added support for 3D triangular Chebyshev quadrature.
	  - In QuadServices, add a missing  gsl_permutation_free, to match
	    gsl_permutation_alloc. This eliminates the five memory leaks
	    reported by valgrind.

	special_functions:
	  - Add an exponential integral evaluation function, ExpInt. This
	    routine is extracted from from Numerical Recipes for C++.  It
	    computes the general exponential integrals of type Ei(x) or
	    E_n(x).

	    E_n(x) is calculated either by special case definitions for
	    n=0 or x=0 with n=0 or 1, or the Lentz algorithm if x>1.0, or
	    the digamma series representation for greater x.

           Ei(x) is calculated using power series expansion for
	    x<|ln(EPS)|, where EPS is the required relative error (set to
	    machine precision), as this is the lower limit of the
	    asymptotic series, which is used for greater values of x. The
	    asymptotic series includes all converging terms until values
	    are less than EPS. Ei(-x) evaluates to the extension -E_1(x).

	timestep:
	  - Refactor some code and the unit tests to improve code
	    coverage.  In particular, capture some of the output that was
	    going to cout and examine it from within the tests.

	traits:
	- With the retirement of Release.cc, this component is now a
	    header only package.  No library will be built or installed.

	Defects:
	  - Known defects are listed on LANL's TeamForge web server,
	    tf.lanl.gov.  Here is a list of known defects:

	    + cdi_gandolf will crash with a segmentation violation if a
	      bad key is provided.
	    +c4/tstComm_Dup fails for optimized builds on Cielito.

2011-03-23  Kelly (KT) Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* draco: Release draco-6_1_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-5_2_0
	  - wedgehog-7_2_0
	  - capsaicin

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 217 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - This release does not include the packages pcgWrap or plot2D.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Clean up for the CMake-based build system.  Eliminate variables
	    DRACO_BUILD_TESTS, DRACO_NUM_CORES.
	  - Tie the build system closer to the Draco Modules feature.
	  - Impovements to the regression/CDash system, including nightly
	    valgrind and coverage testing.  Provide warning/error
	    suppression for specific cases (errors in mpirun and cmake).
	  - Replace FindCLAPACK.cmake with a slightly modified
	    FindLAPACK.cmake and FindBLAS.cmake scripts that were provided
	    with cmake-2.8.4.
	  - The default build type will now be DEBUG.
	  - compilerEnv.cmake is now aware of gfortran.
	  - Improvements for parallel ctest environment include adding
	    '--mca mpi_paffinity_alone 0' as an option to mpirun and allowing
	    test dependencies, resource locks and working directory
	    specifications.
	  - Add '-cpp' to the CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS to enable CPP for
	    '#include' directives.
	  - For Intel compilers, suppress remarks issued by the compiler,
	    change the default Release optimization to '-O1' and turn on
	    whole program optimization.
	  - Improved autodoc support when run with CMake.

	Developer Environment:
	  - Demonstrate support for Eclipse with CDT.
	  - Module support improved -- especially on turing and
	    yellowrail.
	  - Elisp support improved -- correctly indent namespace blocks
	    and use font-lock for special 'Draco' keywords.
	  - Improvements for Xcode on OS/X (list headers in project
	    files).

	c4:
	  - Update the way ApplicationUnitTest works so that it will pass
	    the unit tests on Cielito.
	  - Send_Receive.hh: Sender now holds onto size in a private
	    member variable, to avoid having it go out of scope before the
	    send completes. This resolves the failure of the single-PE
	    "auto-communication test" in tstSend_Receive on Cielito.  This
	    test has typically passed on other machines, probably due to
	    lucky buffering by MPI.  MPI_Isend will not block waiting for
	    a matching receive, but it's not required to buffer data.  The
	    send buffer can only be safely reused (or destroyed, by any
	    mechanism) after the send completes; i.e., after a Wait or
	    Test.

	quadrature:
	  - Sort the ordinates based on a comparator supplied to the
	    QuadServices constructor.
	  - Fix inconsistency in ordering of ordinates. Fix incorrect
	    multiplication of source by opacity. Now returns constant
	    solution for S6 and source boundaries.
	  - Added a 3D triangular Chebyshev quadrature.

	rng:
	  - Add DbC Require() for calling 3rd ctor of LF_Gen to avoid
	    problem that KT and Gabe debugged yesterday (entries in
	    _data[] must have specific values).
	  - Commented out dead code.
	  - Add #ifdef DEBUG around assert() calls.
	  - Generalize tstRnd_Control_inline.cc to allow the test to pass
	    in both reproducible and NR modes.
	  - Initialize special LFG data appropriately, when testing the
	    "existing int array" LF_Gen constructor.  This resolves
	    "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)"
	    warnings from valgrind.

	Defects:
	- artf20096: c4/tstComm_Dup fails for optimized build on
	  Cielito/Cielo.
	- artf20097: build failures when using pgCC 11+ on Cielito/Cielo.

                units
                viz
                xm

	It does not include the following package because they are not
	required by clients running on the big iron or, in the case of
	cdi_eospac, a known compiler incompatibility exists.

                cdi_eospac
                pcgWrap
                plot2D

        Note that stdheaders and meshReaders_Services have been retired
	from draco.

	There are significant build system changes including the
	introduction of 2 new build system prototypes (Scons and CMake),
	new vendor library support and new defaults.

        Again, see CCS-2:10-50(U) for details.

	* draco: Release draco-5_21_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-5_0_0
	  - milagro-5_0_0
	  - wedgehog-7_0_0
	  - capsaicin-2_11_0

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 584 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - Code base was updated to eliminate many gcc warnings that were
	    generated when configured with the option
	    --enable-all-warnings.
	  - Modifications that do not modify behavior were implemented to
	    provide better multiplatform support (Mac OS-X and MSVC).
	  - Extension of unit tests provides better code coverage.
	  - This release does not include the packages pcgWrap or plot2D.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Added a CMake-based build system that sits parallel to the
  	    existing autoconf-based build system.
	  - Reworked ac_vendors.m4 so that vendors are automatically
	    included for any given build if they vendor libraries are
	    found. That is, you no longer are required to type
	    --with-mpi-inc=<path> if $MPI_INC_DIR is found in the
	    environment.
	  - M4 macros for setting up vendors have been improved to reduce
	    code duplication.
	  - Packages that require vendor code that is not found at
	    configure time will not be build.  That is, we will not
	    attempt to compile pcgWrap if libpcg.a is not found.
	  - The build system now defaults to building parallel aware
	    libraries (--with-c4=mpi) instead of the previous scalar
	    default. --with-c4=shmem is now deprecated.
	  - The draco_config script was improved by allowing it to spawn
	    multiple threads.
	  - Provide new configure options --enable-glibcxx-debug and
	    --enable-all-warnings.
	  - Added support for options --with-cxx=intel | ppu-gcc ppu-g++.
	  - Updated scripts to work with 64-bit BullseyeCoverage tool on
	    Linux64.
	  - Provided a couple of logic change to better support the Darwin
	    platform (help it find libopenmpi.so!).
	  - Added support for Intel Fortran (ifort).
	  - Added support for finding the NDI libraries.

	Doxygen:
	  - Update style sheet and some of the top level documents.

	Developer Environment:
	  - Updated elisp to better support GNU Emacs.

	c4:
	  - Encapsulate platform specific header files to better support
	    non-Linux systems.
	  - Added some scatter and gather operations with multiple
	    convenience interfaces.
	  - Added routines to manage swapping of data between processors.
	  - Update routines to correctly treat the case where message size
	    is zero.  Prevent safe &v[0] type operations so that
	    instrumentation of the code doesn't trip over itself.

	ds++:
	  - Provide support for hiding/exposing symbols in shared object
	    libraries (DLL_SHARED macro).  See ds++/config.h.in for
	    details.
	  - The DbC macro REMEMBER is now defined anytime DBC != 0.
	  - Provide a new header, path.hh, that encapsulates path
	    separation symbols along with a few other file system related
	    behaviors.
	  - Provide a new class Slice that allows viewing a slice of an
	    arbitrary container.

	fpe_trap:
	  - No longer depends on c4.
	  - Throws an exception of a floating point exception is
	    encountered.

	units:
	  - Added cgsh and cgmu unit systems.
	  - Added output unit system specification.

	quadrature:
	  - The Transport_Model/Radiation_Package interface has been
	    refactored.
	  - All quadrature sets are now normalized so that their weights
	    sum to 1.
	  - Provided triangular Chebyshev-Legendre quadrature set.

	special_functions:
	  - Eliminate code that will always overflow.
	  - Change the signature of KroneckerDelta so that it returns an
	    unsigned integer.

	* Statistics:

2008-08-18  Seth R. Johnson  <sethrj@umich.edu>

        * Implementation of Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) method with
        multiple groups (ODFMG), see tech memo CCS-2-2-08-52

                - New opacity class: OdfmgOpacity returns opacities with one more
                dimension than multigroup (some number of opacity "bands" per group)
                - New gandolf class: GandolfOdfmgOpacity, which inherits from
                OdfmgOpacity, interfaces with an IPCRESS file written with the TOPS odf
                capability. The number of opacity bands is passed to the constructor,
                which unflattens the apparently multigroup data inside the IPCRESS file.
                It interprets the band structure (one structure per file, not one per
                group) and group boundaries, and returns opacities that have the extra
                dimension of bands.
                - New analytic opacity class: Analytic_Odfmg_Opacity is an almost
                identical copy of Analytic_Multigroup_Opacity. Its difference is that it
                stores the band boundaries, and it replicates the opacities generated by
                the multigroup models to return a multi-band, multi-group opacity. Note
                that its input has only one model per group, regardless of the number of
                bands: it simply copies the output of the model to every band.
                - Modifications to CDI to support ODFMG model, return band structure
                (opacityCdfBandBoundaries). Most ODFMG code in CDI is based on
                multigroup code.

                - New member function for each opacity class: getOpacityModelType
                returns an enum of OpacityModelType that indicates whether it is an
                analytic or Gandolf opacity. Previously, typeid checking was used in
                Milagro to determine the opacity class at runtime.
                - New utility ReadOdfGandolfFile inside cdi_gandolf/test: reads data
                from multigroup or odf-enabled IPCRESS files.

        * bug fixes/issues

                - Changed Gandolf data keys for Planck model in GandolfDataTable.cc. It
                previously misreported absorption opacities as being total opacities
                (both multigroup and gray). IPCRESS files have Planck absorption
                opacities, and no Planck total opacities. See: R. L. Judd, C. J. Fontes,
                and H. L. Zhang, "Gandolf Interface Rou- tines for IPCRESS Files," Tech.

                checking to see if Wtime and wall_clock_time()
                return equivalent values to prevent tests from
                failing in scalar mode.  We now just check
                to see that they are approximately equal.

        cdi_gandolf

2005-10-05  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

        * parser: I moved the parser package from Capsaicin to Draco.  The
          motivation for this change is based on the generic nature of the
          parser, the relative stability of this code and it's possible
          use by other development teams.

        * draco: Released draco-5_5_0.  This is a minor draco release.
        Changes are:

                - config: Moved all of STLPort setup to a new m4 function;
                - doc: Updated Makefiles and .tex files for gettingStarted
                       to be compatible with new location of Draco LaTeX
                       environment.
                - environment: Updated configure.package.ac so that
                       includes examples of setting up new vendors: GSL,
                       BLACS, SCALAPACK and HYPRE.
                - src: Updated configure.ac to reflect the retirement of
                       stdheaders and the addition of norms.
                - RTT_Format_Reader: Improved robustness of reader when
                       comment only lines are found in the rtt mesh file.
                - c4: Restructured the Timer class so that it can always
                       provide POSIX timer information, even when compiled
                       with MPI.  If MPI is available, also provide access
                       to the MPI_Wtime() timer values.  This release
                       includes support for the Darwin operating system.
                - ds++: Updated the File_Streams class to improve
                       performance.
                - meshReaders_Services: Corrected some logic to prevent
                       potential out-of-bounds memory read.
                - quadrature: Modified the computation of 1D
                       Guass-Legendre quadrature set for higher
                       precision;  Corrected the value returned by
                       Q[23]DLevelSym.getLevels(); Provide public access
                       to DbC checks for D and M being inverse matrices of
                       each other; Add these checks to unit tests;  Add
                       tests of applyD() and applyM() functions; Add test
                       of QuadServices constructor where the lkMoments are
                       provided by the user; Added tests to improve code
                       coverage values.

                - config: Major update to apptest_modules.py; Constructor
                       no longer needs to know about the arguments
                       exec_head or test_name;  These are now determined
                       by the apptest class;  The actual number of cpus
                       used is now a part of the test banner; Added
                       soft_equiv test functions; Added a new class
                       GMVFile to parse a GMV file and make it's contents
                       available to a calling routine;
                       regression_filter.py was updated to report on
                       coverage values if available.

        Packages included in this release:

                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4
                cdi

                units
                viz
                xm

        Package that are NOT included:

                cdi_eospac
                pcgWrap

             We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler
             issues have been resolved [hopefully with the release of a C
             version of EOSPAC].

             We are not releasing pcgWrap in draco until the pcgWrap
             component in Draco is updated to only call double precision
             routines.  The single precision routines in libpcg have been
             removed in recent versions.

             For the first time, the package norms is available as a part
             of a Draco release.

        Code Statistics:

             These numbers do not include pcgWrap, cdi_eospac or
             regression scripts.

        * config/ac_platforms.m4 (AC_DBS_LAHEY_ENVIRONMENT): Created a new
        m4 function that will modify the RPATH and LIBS environment
        variables by appending the Lahey lib directory.  Additionally, the
        Lahey compiler libraries are appended to LIBS.  RPATH and LIBS are
        only modified for components that require the Lahey libraries at
        link time (cdi_eospac and trilinos).

        * src/configure.ac (Level 3): Removed cdi_eospac from list of
        packages to build and test because EOSPAC-5.35 is not fully
        compatible with Lahey 6.2.  See SF tracker at
        https://sourceforge-web.lanl.gov/tracker/?aid=4566.

        * draco: Released draco-5_3_0.  This is a minor draco release.  A
        summary of changes are:

        - autodoc: Recent mods look for dcc files in the top level autodoc
          direcotry.
        - elisp: some small changes to improve font lock for DbC keywords.
        - c4: new broadcast signatures.
        - ds++: extensions to RCF and addition of File_Streams class.
        - quadrature: finished addition of QuadServices class.  New
          dependance on vendor GSL. Mods to build system were also made to
          provide GSL as a draco vendor.
        - viz: switched to ensight gold format; added write_part() member
          function.
        - tools: added launchtest as an installed tool to improve
          mpirun compatibility on lambda.

        This draco release includes the following packages:

                RTT_Format_Reader 
                c4

        We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler issues
        have been resolved [hopefully with the release of a C version of
        EOSPAC].

        We are not releasing pcgWrap in draco until the pcgWrap component
        in Draco is updated to only call double precision routines.  The
        single precision routines in libpcg have been removed in recent
        versions. 

        We are not releaseing shared_lib in draco until this package
        passes its unit tests on QSC.

        EOSPAC].

2004-04-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Released draco-5_0_0.  See CCS-4:04-36 for details about
        the release.  This draco release includes the following component
        packages:

                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_gandolf
                ds++
                lapack_wrap
                meshReaders
                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap
                plot2D
                quadrature
                rng
                stdheaders
                timestep
                traits
                units
                viz
                xm

        Note that imc and mc have been moved out of draco [to clubimc].
        Also, we have not released cdi_eospac as part of draco-5_0_0
        because of compiler issues involving EOSPAC.

        There are significant build system changes particularly with
        regard to the autodoc system [see CCS-4:04-25].  

        The Project Thuban [CCS-4:04-21] directory reorganization has been
        completed.  The draco development environment files have been
        moved to draco/environment.  Also, draco CVS now exists at
        sf.lanl.gov:/cvsroot/draco [draco SourceForge page].

        Again, see CCS-4:04-36 for details.

2004-04-19  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * src/*/autodoc/*: added autodoc/pkg.dcc to each draco package to
        conform to the new draco doxygenization system.

2004-04-13  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * src/Makefile.in: Because of upgrades to
        config/Makefile.dep.general, we can now do full parallel builds
        [including parallel dependency builds].

2004-04-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * mc, imc: Moved these packages to CLUBIMC library.  The last
        versions in draco were mc-4_0_0 and imc-4_0_0.  These tags were
        added just before the move.  Obviously, any history prior to these
        versions lives in draco, not clubimc. [Side Note: mc had one
        accidental commit to its ChangeLog after mc-4_0_0 tag.  This can
        be ignored].

2004-04-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Moved to SourceForge CVS control.  Formal time of move:

                2004-04-06: 12:00 p.m.

2004-03-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: release draco-4_3_0.  This is a minor release, as such it
        does not have a release memo associated with it.  In summary, the
        changes are:

                - added RCF and Vector_Lite to ds++
                - added MG surface tallies to imc particles tracking
                - small additions to draco-stdheaders
                - moved elisp XEmacs development environment to draco

        This draco release includes the following packages:
        
                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4
                cdi

                viz
                xm

        The forthcoming changes in draco will include moving the mc and
        imc packages into a Jayenne project source directory.

2004-01-13  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>
        
        * draco: release draco-4_2_0.  This is a minor release, as such it
        does not have a release memo associated with it.  In summary, the
        changes are:

                - added code test coverage to doc/code_stats; this data
                  will be provided in future release notes
                - changes in ds++ classes as a result of KT's elint work;
                  these changes do not affect the package interface
                - imc has several changes; chief among these are full
                  surface tally integration
                - mc has the sphyramid mesh added
                - the units package has been redesigned
                - cdi_eospac now checks that the Lahey compiler is in the
                  path.  This is an EOSPAC issue.  See the
                  cdi_eospac/ChangeLog for details.

        This version of draco has been tested successfully with gcc-3.3.2.
                
        This draco release includes the following packages:
        
                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4
                cdi

        * draco: release draco-4_0_0. This is a major release with
        relatively minor changes from draco-3_2_0.  See
        draco/doc/releases/draco-4_0_0.tex for detail.  We are making this
        a major change because of the significant build system changes
        between draco-3_1_0 and draco-3_2_0.  In summary the changes are:

                - updates to mc and imc for random walk and surface
                  tracking
                - small build system improvements
                - some tool improvements

        * draco: release draco-3_1_0.  This is a minor release that
        predates some [more] significant changes.  A summary of changes in
        this release is:

                - updated tests with return 0; statements in some packages
                - gray random walk implemented in imc package
                - surfaces added to mc package
                - small mods to c4 that returns the count after an async
                  receive 
                - improved templates
                - additions for IBM xlC compiler support
                - the find_tags.py and find_tags_diff.py tools have
                  been updated for more general usage

        This release includes the following packages:

                c4
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_eospac
                cdi_gandolf
                ds++
                imc
                lapack_wrap
                mc
                meshReaders
                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap
                plot2D
                quadrature
                rng
                RTT_Format_Reader
                stdheaders
                timestep
                traits
                units
                viz
                xm

        Because this is a minor release we have not formally documented it
        with a release note. Also, we have not updated the code
        statistics. 

2003-06-04  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-3_0_0.  We have adopted some new policies,
        in particular, we now will not require package tags to be
        synchronized with the draco tag.  The package tags should be used
        for interim package releases [in between draco releases].  

        We will now be more proactive about documenting major draco
        releases.  As part of that spirit, see "Release of Draco-3_0_0" in
        draco/doc/releases/draco-3_0_0.tex for details of this release.

        The following packages are part of this release:
        
                c4 
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_eospac 
                cdi_gandolf 
                ds++ 
                imc 
                lapack_wrap
                mc 
                meshReaders 
                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap 
                plot2D 
                quadrature 
                rng 
                RTT_Format_Reader 
                stdheaders
                timestep 
                traits 
                units 
                viz 
                xm 

        They all have draco-3_0_0 tags as their latest release.

        We will be releasing a new version of the "Draco Release Policy
        and Procedures" document to cover the new release policy.

        We will also be releasing a new version of the "The Draco Build
        System".  This release contains all build system updates
        documented in this file since draco-2_4_0.

2003-05-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco/config: updated to [hopefully] work correctly on the IBM
        platform.  I added platform-specific makefiles for dependency
        rules.  This is necesary because the IBM xlC compiler works goofy
        when it comes to dependencies.

2003-04-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco, draco/config: committed first set of changes to make the
        build system autoconf > 2.5 compliant.  This commit changed the
        following: 

                - Each directory now has its own aclocal.m4 [generated by
                automake] and configure [generated by autoconf].  Both of
                these files are stored in cvs.

                - The configure.in's have been replaced by configure.ac's
                matching the autoconf manual spec.

                - We updated some configure macros, particularly those
                that determined the word-sizes.  Vendor defines are no
                done in a body at the end of AC_DRACO_ENV.  This
                necessitates adding the vendor defines to the
                AC_VENDOR_DEFINES macro.

                - We added all the variable substitutions to the
                AC_DBS_VAR_SUBSTITUTIONS macro.

                - We will be releasing draco as an entity in the next
                release cycle.

                - Make no longer automatically checks the configure system
                as a dependency.  We have provided the targets gmake
                configure and gmake reconfigure to manually do this.

                - The draco_config script effectively replaces autoreconf
                for building configure infrastructure in the draco source
                directory.

        We will be releasing a technical note describing the build
        system updates.  We will also update the draco release procedures
        document.  The draco build system doxygen page will also get
        updated.  

        We will continue to tweak this until draco-3_0_0.  This release
        will be the first draco release with the "new" build system.
        
2003-04-28  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco, draco/config: updated draco build system to use autoconf
        > 1.5.  This version of autoconf is NOT backward compatible with
        autoconf 2.1*.  This update results in many changes:

                - no longer will configure/build system stuff get
                automatically built during gmake; you can manually rebuild
                configure stuff with the new makefile targets gmake
                configure and gmake reconfigure

                - we will now start releasing draco under one tag, and we
                will not update each package tag to correspond with a
                draco tag.  Package tags are still valid; however, they do
                not have to be sync'd with a draco tag.  The draco tag [or
                package] tag will signify the latest version of a package.

                - We are now storing aclocal.m4 and configure files in
                each package directory.

2003-03-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_4_0.  This release contains the
        following packages:

        See package ChangeLogs for package details.  On the draco front we
        changed:
                
                1) better doxygen front page
                2) build-system documentation
                3) new improved templates
                4) small build system fixes [Compaq link options]
                5) moved draco/Merge and draco/assesment to 
                   draco/doc/merge and draco/doc/assessment

        Made significant update to build system.  The libraries are now
        built prefixed by a rtt_ by default.  For example, the ds++
        package library will be:

                librtt_ds++.a(so)

        Everything else is the same.  The prefix is added to the Makefiles
        at configure time.  Packages are still referenced by their package
        name, not library name.  The prefix can be changed by the
        --with-lib-prefix configure option.

        This change will help avoid library name collisions.  The
        following files were changed to accomodate the update:

                config/Makefile.package.in
                config/Makefile.test.in
                config/ac_conf.m4
                config/ac_draco_vendor.m4
                config/ac_dracoarg.m4
                config/ac_dracoenv.m4
                config/doc/build_system.dcc

2002-12-10  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * radphys: Retired radphys (corresponded to radphys-1_5_0).  This
        package simply was not standard compliant.

2002-11-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_2_0.  This release includes the

                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                stdheaders-1_3_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0

                viz-1_3_0
                xm-1_4_0

        This release mainly has fixes for standard-compliant compiler
        stuff.  Very minor release, but it does seem to run on all
        systems.  The standard compliant fixes are for gcc 3.2.

2002-09-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * lapack_wrap: Added lapack_wrap component that provides
        C++-wrapped BLAS and LAPACK functions.

2002-08-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_1_0.  It includes the following
        packages:

                ds++-1_6_0
                stdheaders-1_2_0
                c4-2_1_0
                traits-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                xm-1_3_0
                rng-1_6_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0
                cdi-1_2_0
                quadrature-1_1_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0
                plot2D-1_0_0
                timestep-1_3_0
                pcgWrap-1_1_0
                viz-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
                cdi_eospac-1_1_0
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0
                mc-3_1_0
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
                imc-3_1_0

        This is a minor draco release.  Most of the packages have been
        tested with the COMPAQ 6_5_0 compiler (all packages used by IMC
        codes).  Some build system updates were added: principally, draco
        can now be used as a vendor by clients using the draco build
        system.  It also has expanded COMPAQ support.

        We still have the following to work on:
                
                - support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
                  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
                  must be able to be generated
                - better F90 integration
                - better documentation for draco build system

2002-05-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_0_0.  The following packages no longer
        have their own tags:

                config
                tools
                templates

        The new policy is that only packages under draco/src have their
        own formal tags.  All other parts of draco simply carry a release
        tag.  This release of draco contains the following tagged
        packages:

                ds++-1_6_0
                stdheaders-1_2_0
                c4-2_0_0
                traits-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                xm-1_3_0
                rng-1_6_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0
                cdi-1_2_0
                quadrature-1_1_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0
                plot2D-1_0_0
                timestep-1_3_0
                pcgWrap-1_1_0
                viz-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
                cdi_eospac-1_1_0
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0
                mc-3_0_0
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
                imc-3_0_0

        Pre-built versions of draco are available on
        /radtran/vendors/draco.  This is a link that points to the latest
        release. 

        As of this release, all of draco is required to build with the g++
        (> 3.0.1) compiler.  This is, of course, subject to discussion;
        however, we will keep this as a general rule.  

        The build system has been significantly updated:

                - real support for autodoc (doxygen)
                - cleaned up compiler and vendor support
                - support cxx, gcc, kcc, and SGI CC compilers
                - improved support for F90

        We still have the following to work on:
                
                - support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
                  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
                  must be able to be generated
                - better F90 integration
                - better documentation for draco build system

        To figure out the parameters of a draco build, use the bin/draco
        tool.  This script will tell the following info:

                - version of draco
                - configure options used in build
                - installation prefix

        As implied above, it gets installed inside of bin. Use draco
        --help to query options.

2001-10-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * doc/design: added draco levelization diagrams reflecting current
        version of draco.

        * src/configure.in: updated this configure.in to reflect the
        current state of draco.

        * draco: on this date--between release 1_0_0 and 2_0_0--draco has
        the following packages:

                level 1: ds++ stdheaders
                level 2: xm rng c4 units traits UnitTestFrame cdi
                level 3: timestep pcgWrap stopwatch quadrature radphys
                         ConjGrad meshReaders viz cdi_eospac 
                         cdi_gandolf cdi_analytic
                level 4: RTT_Format_Reader
                level 5: mc meshReaders_Services
                level 6: imc

        * pcgWrap: changed linalg to pcgWrap.  Released pcgWrap-1_0_0.
        This is a temporary package because pcg is no longer supported at
        the lab.  It will be superceded in the near future.

        * config: build-system improvements.  Notably, cleaned up vendor
        stuff--added with-lapack, with-gandolf, with-pcg, removed
        with-pcglib.

2000-05-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco/: Released draco version draco-1_0_0.  This version
        contains the following sub-directories:

                src/
                doc/
                templates/
                autodoc/

        It contains the following packages under draco/:

                config-1_2_0
                tools-1_0_0

        It contains the following packages under draco/src/:

                mesh-1_8_0
                meshReaders-1_0_0
                imc-1_3_0
                mc-1_2_0
                rng-1_3_0
                c4-1_3_0
                viz-1_0_0 
                timestep-1_2_0
                xm-1_2_0
                stopwatch-1_1_0
                matprops-1_4_0
                nml-1_2_0
                UnitTestFrame-1_0_0
                traits-1_3_0
                diffusion-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                ds++-1_3_0
                P1Diffusion-1_5_0
                ConjGradDiffusionSolver-1_0_0
                ConjGrad-1_0_0
                meshTest-1_2_0

        All regression tests in these packages passed on mikonos utilizing 
        the following configuration:

                draco_config .. --with-c4=mpi 
                --with-mpi-inc=/usr/local/mpich/include 
                --with-mpi-lib=/usr/local/mpich/lib 
                --with-sprng-inc=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/include 
                --with-sprng-lib=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/lib

        KCC 3.4g (LINUX) was used as the compiler.  See Memo
        X-6:00-22(U). For details.

1999-09-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * templates: update templates to 1_1_0, added ChangeLog file to
        templates directory.  In the future, each package in draco that
        maintains its own numbered release tag, autodoc, templates,
        config, c4, ds++, etc. should have their own ChangeLog files to
        record package-wide changes.  The draco ChangeLog will only record 
        draco-specific changes, releases, etc.  Of course, developers
        should feel free to "mirror" any changes noted in the individual
        package ChangeLogs to the draco ChangeLogs.  Even comments such
        as, "made changes in templates" are effective, as a user could
        simply peruse the templates ChangeLog file to see actual changes
        made. 

1999-09-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
        document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
        to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
        documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
        gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
        Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
        and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
        target yet.

        * src (all directories): initial release.
