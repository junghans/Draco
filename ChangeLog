                viz
                xm

	It does not include the following package because they are not
	required by clients running on the big iron or, in the case of
	cdi_eospac, a known compiler incompatibility exists.

                cdi_eospac
                pcgWrap
                plot2D

        Note that stdheaders and meshReaders_Services have been retired
	from draco.

	There are significant build system changes including the
	introduction of 2 new build system prototypes (Scons and CMake),
	new vendor library support and new defaults.

        Again, see CCS-2:10-50(U) for details.

	* draco: Release draco-5_21_0.  This is a minor Draco release.

	* This release was required by Jayenne and Capsaicin.  It is
          linked to:
	  - clubimc-5_0_0
	  - milagro-5_0_0
	  - wedgehog-7_0_0
	  - capsaicin-2_11_0

	* Summary of changes:
	  - 584 files were changed, added or removed.
	  - Code base was updated to eliminate many gcc warnings that were
	    generated when configured with the option
	    --enable-all-warnings.
	  - Modifications that do not modify behavior were implemented to
	    provide better multiplatform support (Mac OS-X and MSVC).
	  - Extension of unit tests provides better code coverage.
	  - This release does not include the packages pcgWrap or plot2D.

	* Details per package:

	Build System:
	  - Added a CMake-based build system that sits parallel to the
  	    existing autoconf-based build system.
	  - Reworked ac_vendors.m4 so that vendors are automatically
	    included for any given build if they vendor libraries are
	    found. That is, you no longer are required to type
	    --with-mpi-inc=<path> if $MPI_INC_DIR is found in the
	    environment.
	  - M4 macros for setting up vendors have been improved to reduce
	    code duplication.
	  - Packages that require vendor code that is not found at
	    configure time will not be build.  That is, we will not
	    attempt to compile pcgWrap if libpcg.a is not found.
	  - The build system now defaults to building parallel aware
	    libraries (--with-c4=mpi) instead of the previous scalar
	    default. --with-c4=shmem is now deprecated.
	  - The draco_config script was improved by allowing it to spawn
	    multiple threads.
	  - Provide new configure options --enable-glibcxx-debug and
	    --enable-all-warnings.
	  - Added support for options --with-cxx=intel | ppu-gcc ppu-g++.
	  - Updated scripts to work with 64-bit BullseyeCoverage tool on
	    Linux64.
	  - Provided a couple of logic change to better support the Darwin
	    platform (help it find libopenmpi.so!).
	  - Added support for Intel Fortran (ifort).
	  - Added support for finding the NDI libraries.

	Doxygen:
	  - Update style sheet and some of the top level documents.

	Developer Environment:
	  - Updated elisp to better support GNU Emacs.

	c4:
	  - Encapsulate platform specific header files to better support
	    non-Linux systems.
	  - Added some scatter and gather operations with multiple
	    convenience interfaces.
	  - Added routines to manage swapping of data between processors.
	  - Update routines to correctly treat the case where message size
	    is zero.  Prevent safe &v[0] type operations so that
	    instrumentation of the code doesn't trip over itself.

	ds++:
	  - Provide support for hiding/exposing symbols in shared object
	    libraries (DLL_SHARED macro).  See ds++/config.h.in for
	    details.
	  - The DbC macro REMEMBER is now defined anytime DBC != 0.
	  - Provide a new header, path.hh, that encapsulates path
	    separation symbols along with a few other file system related
	    behaviors.
	  - Provide a new class Slice that allows viewing a slice of an
	    arbitrary container.

	fpe_trap:
	  - No longer depends on c4.
	  - Throws an exception of a floating point exception is
	    encountered.

	units:
	  - Added cgsh and cgmu unit systems.
	  - Added output unit system specification.

	quadrature:
	  - The Transport_Model/Radiation_Package interface has been
	    refactored.
	  - All quadrature sets are now normalized so that their weights
	    sum to 1.
	  - Provided triangular Chebyshev-Legendre quadrature set.

	special_functions:
	  - Eliminate code that will always overflow.
	  - Change the signature of KroneckerDelta so that it returns an
	    unsigned integer.

2008-08-18  Seth R. Johnson  <sethrj@umich.edu>

        * Implementation of Opacity Distribution Function (ODF) method with
        multiple groups (ODFMG), see tech memo CCS-2-2-08-52

                - New opacity class: OdfmgOpacity returns opacities with one more
                dimension than multigroup (some number of opacity "bands" per group)
                - New gandolf class: GandolfOdfmgOpacity, which inherits from
                OdfmgOpacity, interfaces with an IPCRESS file written with the TOPS odf
                capability. The number of opacity bands is passed to the constructor,
                which unflattens the apparently multigroup data inside the IPCRESS file.
                It interprets the band structure (one structure per file, not one per
                group) and group boundaries, and returns opacities that have the extra
                dimension of bands.
                - New analytic opacity class: Analytic_Odfmg_Opacity is an almost
                identical copy of Analytic_Multigroup_Opacity. Its difference is that it
                stores the band boundaries, and it replicates the opacities generated by
                the multigroup models to return a multi-band, multi-group opacity. Note
                that its input has only one model per group, regardless of the number of
                bands: it simply copies the output of the model to every band.
                - Modifications to CDI to support ODFMG model, return band structure
                (opacityCdfBandBoundaries). Most ODFMG code in CDI is based on
                multigroup code.

                - New member function for each opacity class: getOpacityModelType
                returns an enum of OpacityModelType that indicates whether it is an
                analytic or Gandolf opacity. Previously, typeid checking was used in
                Milagro to determine the opacity class at runtime.
                - New utility ReadOdfGandolfFile inside cdi_gandolf/test: reads data
                from multigroup or odf-enabled IPCRESS files.

        * bug fixes/issues

                - Changed Gandolf data keys for Planck model in GandolfDataTable.cc. It
                previously misreported absorption opacities as being total opacities
                (both multigroup and gray). IPCRESS files have Planck absorption
                opacities, and no Planck total opacities. See: R. L. Judd, C. J. Fontes,
                and H. L. Zhang, "Gandolf Interface Rou- tines for IPCRESS Files," Tech.

2005-10-05  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

        * parser: I moved the parser package from Capsaicin to Draco.  The
          motivation for this change is based on the generic nature of the
          parser, the relative stability of this code and it's possible
          use by other development teams.

2005-02-25  Kelly Thompson <kgt@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Released draco-5_5_0.  This is a minor draco release.
        Changes are:

                - config: Moved all of STLPort setup to a new m4 function;
                - doc: Updated Makefiles and .tex files for gettingStarted
                       to be compatible with new location of Draco LaTeX
                       environment.
                - environment: Updated configure.package.ac so that
                       includes examples of setting up new vendors: GSL,
                       BLACS, SCALAPACK and HYPRE.
                - src: Updated configure.ac to reflect the retirement of
                       stdheaders and the addition of norms.
                - RTT_Format_Reader: Improved robustness of reader when
                       comment only lines are found in the rtt mesh file.
                - c4: Restructured the Timer class so that it can always
                       provide POSIX timer information, even when compiled
                       with MPI.  If MPI is available, also provide access
                       to the MPI_Wtime() timer values.  This release
                       includes support for the Darwin operating system.
                - ds++: Updated the File_Streams class to improve
                       performance.
                - meshReaders_Services: Corrected some logic to prevent
                       potential out-of-bounds memory read.
                - quadrature: Modified the computation of 1D
                       Guass-Legendre quadrature set for higher
                       precision;  Corrected the value returned by
                       Q[23]DLevelSym.getLevels(); Provide public access
                       to DbC checks for D and M being inverse matrices of
                       each other; Add these checks to unit tests;  Add
                       tests of applyD() and applyM() functions; Add test
                       of QuadServices constructor where the lkMoments are
                       provided by the user; Added tests to improve code
                       coverage values.

                - config: Major update to apptest_modules.py; Constructor
                       no longer needs to know about the arguments
                       exec_head or test_name;  These are now determined
                       by the apptest class;  The actual number of cpus
                       used is now a part of the test banner; Added
                       soft_equiv test functions; Added a new class
                       GMVFile to parse a GMV file and make it's contents
                       available to a calling routine;
                       regression_filter.py was updated to report on
                       coverage values if available.

        Packages included in this release:

                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4

        Package that are NOT included:

                cdi_eospac
                pcgWrap

             We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler
             issues have been resolved [hopefully with the release of a C
             version of EOSPAC].

             We are not releasing pcgWrap in draco until the pcgWrap
             component in Draco is updated to only call double precision
             routines.  The single precision routines in libpcg have been
             removed in recent versions.

             For the first time, the package norms is available as a part
             of a Draco release.

        Code Statistics:

             These numbers do not include pcgWrap, cdi_eospac or
             regression scripts.

2005-01-12  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

        * config/ac_platforms.m4 (AC_DBS_LAHEY_ENVIRONMENT): Created a new
        m4 function that will modify the RPATH and LIBS environment
        variables by appending the Lahey lib directory.  Additionally, the
        Lahey compiler libraries are appended to LIBS.  RPATH and LIBS are
        only modified for components that require the Lahey libraries at
        link time (cdi_eospac and trilinos).

        * src/configure.ac (Level 3): Removed cdi_eospac from list of
        packages to build and test because EOSPAC-5.35 is not fully
        compatible with Lahey 6.2.  See SF tracker at
        https://sourceforge-web.lanl.gov/tracker/?aid=4566.

2004-12-02  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Released draco-5_3_0.  This is a minor draco release.  A
        summary of changes are:

        - autodoc: Recent mods look for dcc files in the top level autodoc
          direcotry.
        - elisp: some small changes to improve font lock for DbC keywords.
        - c4: new broadcast signatures.
        - ds++: extensions to RCF and addition of File_Streams class.
        - quadrature: finished addition of QuadServices class.  New
          dependance on vendor GSL. Mods to build system were also made to
          provide GSL as a draco vendor.
        - viz: switched to ensight gold format; added write_part() member
          function.
        - tools: added launchtest as an installed tool to improve
          mpirun compatibility on lambda.

        This draco release includes the following packages:

                RTT_Format_Reader 
                c4
                cdi 
                cdi_analytic

                units
                viz
                xm
        
        We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler issues
        have been resolved [hopefully with the release of a C version of
        EOSPAC].

        We are not releasing pcgWrap in draco until the pcgWrap component
        in Draco is updated to only call double precision routines.  The
        single precision routines in libpcg have been removed in recent
        versions. 

        We are not releaseing shared_lib in draco until this package
        passes its unit tests on QSC.

        * draco: Released draco-5_2_0.  This is a minor draco release.  A
        summary of changes are:

        - build systems chages: more darwin support, vendors added 
        - timestep: improvements to field_ts_advisor
        - quadrature: beginning of significant redesign
        - shared_lib: added to released packages; only on when compile in
          shared mode

        Removed get_tex script because it is no longer needed [the tex
        stuff resides in environment].

        This draco release includes the following packages:

                RTT_Format_Reader 
                c4

        We are not releasing cdi_eospac in draco until the compiler issues

        EOSPAC].

        * draco: Released draco-5_1_0.  This is a minor draco release. A
        summary of changes are:

        - build system changes: support for darwin [MacOS], dlopen
          support,  changed Q template option to -pt, improved autodoc
          support over last release
        - meshReaders has been redesigned with its base functionality
          moved to the mesh_element component

        This draco release includes the following packages:

                rng
                ds++
                shared_lib
                RTT_Format_Reader

        EOSPAC].

2004-04-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Released draco-5_0_0.  See CCS-4:04-36 for details about
        the release.  This draco release includes the following component
        packages:

                RTT_Format_Reader
                c4
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_gandolf
                ds++
                lapack_wrap
                meshReaders
                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap
                plot2D
                quadrature
                rng
                stdheaders
                timestep
                traits
                units
                viz
                xm

        Note that imc and mc have been moved out of draco [to clubimc].
        Also, we have not released cdi_eospac as part of draco-5_0_0
        because of compiler issues involving EOSPAC.

        There are significant build system changes particularly with
        regard to the autodoc system [see CCS-4:04-25].  

        The Project Thuban [CCS-4:04-21] directory reorganization has been
        completed.  The draco development environment files have been
        moved to draco/environment.  Also, draco CVS now exists at
        sf.lanl.gov:/cvsroot/draco [draco SourceForge page].

        Again, see CCS-4:04-36 for details.

2004-04-19  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * src/*/autodoc/*: added autodoc/pkg.dcc to each draco package to
        conform to the new draco doxygenization system.

2004-04-13  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * src/Makefile.in: Because of upgrades to
        config/Makefile.dep.general, we can now do full parallel builds
        [including parallel dependency builds].

2004-04-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * mc, imc: Moved these packages to CLUBIMC library.  The last
        versions in draco were mc-4_0_0 and imc-4_0_0.  These tags were
        added just before the move.  Obviously, any history prior to these
        versions lives in draco, not clubimc. [Side Note: mc had one
        accidental commit to its ChangeLog after mc-4_0_0 tag.  This can
        be ignored].

2004-04-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: Moved to SourceForge CVS control.  Formal time of move:

                2004-04-06: 12:00 p.m.

2004-03-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

                - added RCF and Vector_Lite to ds++
                - added MG surface tallies to imc particles tracking
                - small additions to draco-stdheaders
                - moved elisp XEmacs development environment to draco

        * draco: release draco-4_2_0.  This is a minor release, as such it
        does not have a release memo associated with it.  In summary, the
        changes are:

                - added code test coverage to doc/code_stats; this data
                  will be provided in future release notes
                - changes in ds++ classes as a result of KT's elint work;
                  these changes do not affect the package interface
                - imc has several changes; chief among these are full
                  surface tally integration
                - mc has the sphyramid mesh added
                - the units package has been redesigned
                - cdi_eospac now checks that the Lahey compiler is in the
                  path.  This is an EOSPAC issue.  See the
                  cdi_eospac/ChangeLog for details.

        This version of draco has been tested successfully with gcc-3.3.2.
                
        This draco release includes the following packages:

        relatively minor changes from draco-3_2_0.  See
        draco/doc/releases/draco-4_0_0.tex for detail.  We are making this
        a major change because of the significant build system changes
        between draco-3_1_0 and draco-3_2_0.  In summary the changes are:

                - updates to mc and imc for random walk and surface
                  tracking
                - small build system improvements

        * draco: release draco-3_1_0.  This is a minor release that
        predates some [more] significant changes.  A summary of changes in
        this release is:

                - updated tests with return 0; statements in some packages
                - gray random walk implemented in imc package
                - surfaces added to mc package
                - small mods to c4 that returns the count after an async
                  receive 
                - improved templates
                - additions for IBM xlC compiler support
                - the find_tags.py and find_tags_diff.py tools have
                  been updated for more general usage

        This release includes the following packages:

                c4
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_eospac
                cdi_gandolf
                ds++

                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap
                plot2D
                quadrature
                rng

        Because this is a minor release we have not formally documented it
        with a release note. Also, we have not updated the code
        statistics. 

2003-06-04  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-3_0_0.  We have adopted some new policies,
        in particular, we now will not require package tags to be
        synchronized with the draco tag.  The package tags should be used
        for interim package releases [in between draco releases].  

        We will now be more proactive about documenting major draco
        releases.  As part of that spirit, see "Release of Draco-3_0_0" in
        draco/doc/releases/draco-3_0_0.tex for details of this release.

        The following packages are part of this release:
        
                c4 
                cdi
                cdi_analytic
                cdi_eospac 
                cdi_gandolf 
                ds++ 
                imc 
                lapack_wrap
                mc 
                meshReaders 
                meshReaders_Services
                pcgWrap 
                plot2D 
                quadrature 
                rng 
                RTT_Format_Reader 
                stdheaders
                timestep 
                traits 
                units 
                viz 
                xm 

        They all have draco-3_0_0 tags as their latest release.

        We will be releasing a new version of the "Draco Release Policy
        and Procedures" document to cover the new release policy.

        We will also be releasing a new version of the "The Draco Build
        System".  This release contains all build system updates
        documented in this file since draco-2_4_0.

2003-05-07  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco/config: updated to [hopefully] work correctly on the IBM
        platform.  I added platform-specific makefiles for dependency
        rules.  This is necesary because the IBM xlC compiler works goofy
        when it comes to dependencies.

2003-04-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco, draco/config: committed first set of changes to make the
        build system autoconf > 2.5 compliant.  This commit changed the
        following: 

                - Each directory now has its own aclocal.m4 [generated by
                automake] and configure [generated by autoconf].  Both of
                these files are stored in cvs.

                - The configure.in's have been replaced by configure.ac's
                matching the autoconf manual spec.

                - We updated some configure macros, particularly those
                that determined the word-sizes.  Vendor defines are no
                done in a body at the end of AC_DRACO_ENV.  This
                necessitates adding the vendor defines to the
                AC_VENDOR_DEFINES macro.

                - We added all the variable substitutions to the
                AC_DBS_VAR_SUBSTITUTIONS macro.

                - We will be releasing draco as an entity in the next
                release cycle.

                - Make no longer automatically checks the configure system
                as a dependency.  We have provided the targets gmake
                configure and gmake reconfigure to manually do this.

                - The draco_config script effectively replaces autoreconf
                for building configure infrastructure in the draco source
                directory.

        We will be releasing a technical note describing the build
        system updates.  We will also update the draco release procedures
        document.  The draco build system doxygen page will also get
        updated.  

        We will continue to tweak this until draco-3_0_0.  This release
        will be the first draco release with the "new" build system.

        * draco, draco/config: updated draco build system to use autoconf
        > 1.5.  This version of autoconf is NOT backward compatible with
        autoconf 2.1*.  This update results in many changes:

                - no longer will configure/build system stuff get
                automatically built during gmake; you can manually rebuild
                configure stuff with the new makefile targets gmake
                configure and gmake reconfigure

                - we will now start releasing draco under one tag, and we
                will not update each package tag to correspond with a
                draco tag.  Package tags are still valid; however, they do
                not have to be sync'd with a draco tag.  The draco tag [or
                package] tag will signify the latest version of a package.

                - We are now storing aclocal.m4 and configure files in
                each package directory.

2003-03-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_4_0.  This release contains the
        following packages:

                c4-2_3_0
                cdi-1_3_0
                cdi_analytic-1_1_0
                cdi_eospac-1_2_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_3_0
                ds++-1_9_0
                imc-3_3_0
                lapack_wrap-1_0_0
                mc-3_3_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
                pcgWrap-1_2_0
                plot2D-1_1_0
                quadrature-1_2_0
                rng-1_6_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                stdheaders-1_3_0
                timestep-1_3_0
                traits-1_5_0
                units-1_3_0
                viz-1_3_0
                xm-1_5_0

        See package ChangeLogs for package details.  On the draco front we
        changed:
                
                1) better doxygen front page
                2) build-system documentation
                3) new improved templates
                4) small build system fixes [Compaq link options]
                5) moved draco/Merge and draco/assesment to 
                   draco/doc/merge and draco/doc/assessment

        Made significant update to build system.  The libraries are now
        built prefixed by a rtt_ by default.  For example, the ds++
        package library will be:

                librtt_ds++.a(so)

        Everything else is the same.  The prefix is added to the Makefiles
        at configure time.  Packages are still referenced by their package
        name, not library name.  The prefix can be changed by the
        --with-lib-prefix configure option.

        This change will help avoid library name collisions.  The
        following files were changed to accomodate the update:

                config/Makefile.package.in
                config/Makefile.test.in
                config/ac_conf.m4
                config/ac_draco_vendor.m4
                config/ac_dracoarg.m4
                config/ac_dracoenv.m4
                config/doc/build_system.dcc

2003-02-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * html: removed old John McGhee html info directory.

        * stopwatch: retired stopwatch package (corresponded to
        stopwatch-1_2_0). 

2002-12-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_3_0.  This release contains the

                cdi-1_3_0 
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0
                cdi_eospac-1_2_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_3_0 
                ds++-1_8_0
                imc-3_2_0 
                lapack_wrap-1_0_0
                mc-3_2_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0 
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0          
                pcgWrap-1_1_0
                plot2D-1_1_0
                quadrature-1_2_0
                rng-1_6_0

                xm-1_5_0

                radphys-retired (no longer part of head)

        Mainly small fixes.

2002-12-10  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * radphys: Retired radphys (corresponded to radphys-1_5_0).  This
        package simply was not standard compliant.

2002-11-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_2_0.  This release includes the
        following packages:
        
                c4-2_2_0
                cdi-1_2_0
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0

                rng-1_6_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                stdheaders-1_3_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0 
                timestep-1_3_0
                traits-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0 
                viz-1_3_0
                xm-1_4_0

        This release mainly has fixes for standard-compliant compiler
        stuff.  Very minor release, but it does seem to run on all
        systems.  The standard compliant fixes are for gcc 3.2.

2002-09-05  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * lapack_wrap: Added lapack_wrap component that provides
        C++-wrapped BLAS and LAPACK functions.

2002-08-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_1_0.  It includes the following
        packages:

                ds++-1_6_0
                stdheaders-1_2_0
                c4-2_1_0
                traits-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                xm-1_3_0
                rng-1_6_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0
                cdi-1_2_0
                quadrature-1_1_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0
                plot2D-1_0_0
                timestep-1_3_0
                pcgWrap-1_1_0
                viz-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
                cdi_eospac-1_1_0
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0
                mc-3_1_0
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
                imc-3_1_0

        This is a minor draco release.  Most of the packages have been
        tested with the COMPAQ 6_5_0 compiler (all packages used by IMC
        codes).  Some build system updates were added: principally, draco
        can now be used as a vendor by clients using the draco build
        system.  It also has expanded COMPAQ support.

        We still have the following to work on:
                
                - support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
                  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
                  must be able to be generated
                - better F90 integration
                - better documentation for draco build system

2002-05-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco: released draco-2_0_0.  The following packages no longer
        have their own tags:

                config
                tools
                templates

        The new policy is that only packages under draco/src have their
        own formal tags.  All other parts of draco simply carry a release
        tag.  This release of draco contains the following tagged
        packages:

                ds++-1_6_0
                stdheaders-1_2_0
                c4-2_0_0
                traits-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                xm-1_3_0
                rng-1_6_0
                meshReaders-1_4_0
                cdi-1_2_0
                quadrature-1_1_0
                stopwatch-1_2_0
                plot2D-1_0_0
                timestep-1_3_0
                pcgWrap-1_1_0
                viz-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
                cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
                cdi_eospac-1_1_0
                cdi_analytic-1_0_0
                mc-3_0_0
                meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
                imc-3_0_0

        Pre-built versions of draco are available on
        /radtran/vendors/draco.  This is a link that points to the latest
        release. 

        As of this release, all of draco is required to build with the g++
        (> 3.0.1) compiler.  This is, of course, subject to discussion;
        however, we will keep this as a general rule.  

        The build system has been significantly updated:

                - real support for autodoc (doxygen)
                - cleaned up compiler and vendor support
                - support cxx, gcc, kcc, and SGI CC compilers
                - improved support for F90

        We still have the following to work on:
                
                - support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
                  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
                  must be able to be generated
                - better F90 integration
                - better documentation for draco build system

        To figure out the parameters of a draco build, use the bin/draco
        tool.  This script will tell the following info:

                - version of draco
                - configure options used in build
                - installation prefix

        As implied above, it gets installed inside of bin. Use draco
        --help to query options.

2001-10-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * doc/design: added draco levelization diagrams reflecting current
        version of draco.

        * src/configure.in: updated this configure.in to reflect the
        current state of draco.

        * draco: on this date--between release 1_0_0 and 2_0_0--draco has
        the following packages:

                level 1: ds++ stdheaders
                level 2: xm rng c4 units traits UnitTestFrame cdi
                level 3: timestep pcgWrap stopwatch quadrature radphys
                         ConjGrad meshReaders viz cdi_eospac 
                         cdi_gandolf cdi_analytic
                level 4: RTT_Format_Reader
                level 5: mc meshReaders_Services
                level 6: imc

        * pcgWrap: changed linalg to pcgWrap.  Released pcgWrap-1_0_0.
        This is a temporary package because pcg is no longer supported at
        the lab.  It will be superceded in the near future.

        * config: build-system improvements.  Notably, cleaned up vendor
        stuff--added with-lapack, with-gandolf, with-pcg, removed
        with-pcglib.

2000-05-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * draco/: Released draco version draco-1_0_0.  This version
        contains the following sub-directories:

                src/
                doc/
                templates/
                autodoc/

        It contains the following packages under draco/:

                config-1_2_0
                tools-1_0_0

        It contains the following packages under draco/src/:

                mesh-1_8_0
                meshReaders-1_0_0
                imc-1_3_0
                mc-1_2_0
                rng-1_3_0
                c4-1_3_0
                viz-1_0_0 
                timestep-1_2_0
                xm-1_2_0
                stopwatch-1_1_0
                matprops-1_4_0
                nml-1_2_0
                UnitTestFrame-1_0_0
                traits-1_3_0
                diffusion-1_3_0
                radphys-1_4_0
                units-1_3_0
                ds++-1_3_0
                P1Diffusion-1_5_0
                ConjGradDiffusionSolver-1_0_0
                ConjGrad-1_0_0
                meshTest-1_2_0

        All regression tests in these packages passed on mikonos utilizing 
        the following configuration:

                draco_config .. --with-c4=mpi 
                --with-mpi-inc=/usr/local/mpich/include 
                --with-mpi-lib=/usr/local/mpich/lib 
                --with-sprng-inc=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/include 
                --with-sprng-lib=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/lib

        KCC 3.4g (LINUX) was used as the compiler.  See Memo
        X-6:00-22(U). For details.

1999-09-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * templates: update templates to 1_1_0, added ChangeLog file to
        templates directory.  In the future, each package in draco that
        maintains its own numbered release tag, autodoc, templates,
        config, c4, ds++, etc. should have their own ChangeLog files to
        record package-wide changes.  The draco ChangeLog will only record 
        draco-specific changes, releases, etc.  Of course, developers
        should feel free to "mirror" any changes noted in the individual
        package ChangeLogs to the draco ChangeLogs.  Even comments such
        as, "made changes in templates" are effective, as a user could
        simply peruse the templates ChangeLog file to see actual changes
        made. 

1999-09-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

        * autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
        document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
        to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
        documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
        gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
        Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
        and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
        target yet.

$Id$ 

        * src (all directories): initial release.
