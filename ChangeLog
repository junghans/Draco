	* draco: released draco-2_1_0.  It includes the following
	packages:

		ds++-1_6_0
		stdheaders-1_2_0
		c4-2_1_0
		traits-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0
		xm-1_3_0
		rng-1_6_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		cdi-1_2_0
		quadrature-1_1_0
		stopwatch-1_2_0
		plot2D-1_0_0
		timestep-1_3_0
		pcgWrap-1_1_0
		viz-1_3_0
		radphys-1_4_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
		cdi_eospac-1_1_0
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		mc-3_1_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
		imc-3_1_0

	This is a minor draco release.  Most of the packages have been
	tested with the COMPAQ 6_5_0 compiler (all packages used by IMC
	codes).  Some build system updates were added: principally, draco
	can now be used as a vendor by clients using the draco build
	system.  It also has expanded COMPAQ support.

	We still have the following to work on:
		
		- support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
		  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
		  must be able to be generated
		- better F90 integration
		- better documentation for draco build system

	* draco: released draco-2_0_0.  The following packages no longer
	have their own tags:

		config
		tools
		templates

	The new policy is that only packages under draco/src have their
	own formal tags.  All other parts of draco simply carry a release
	tag.  This release of draco contains the following tagged
	packages:

		ds++-1_6_0
		stdheaders-1_2_0
		c4-2_0_0
		traits-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0
		xm-1_3_0
		rng-1_6_0
		meshReaders-1_4_0
		cdi-1_2_0
		quadrature-1_1_0
		stopwatch-1_2_0
		plot2D-1_0_0
		timestep-1_3_0
		pcgWrap-1_1_0
		viz-1_3_0
		radphys-1_4_0
		RTT_Format_Reader-1_3_0
		cdi_gandolf-1_2_0
		cdi_eospac-1_1_0
		cdi_analytic-1_0_0
		mc-3_0_0
		meshReaders_Services-1_0_0
		imc-3_0_0

	Pre-built versions of draco are available on
	/radtran/vendors/draco.  This is a link that points to the latest
	release. 

	As of this release, all of draco is required to build with the g++
	(> 3.0.1) compiler.  This is, of course, subject to discussion;
	however, we will keep this as a general rule.  

	The build system has been significantly updated:

		- real support for autodoc (doxygen)
		- cleaned up compiler and vendor support
		- support cxx, gcc, kcc, and SGI CC compilers
		- improved support for F90

	We still have the following to work on:
		
		- support for the draco/doc and draco/src/<pkg>/doc
		  builds, native format is not important, but pdfs
		  must be able to be generated
		- better F90 integration
		- better documentation for draco build system

	To figure out the parameters of a draco build, use the bin/draco
	tool.  This script will tell the following info:

		- version of draco
		- configure options used in build
		- installation prefix

	As implied above, it gets installed inside of bin. Use draco
	--help to query options.

	* doc/design: added draco levelization diagrams reflecting current
	version of draco.

	* src/configure.in: updated this configure.in to reflect the
	current state of draco.

	* draco: on this date--between release 1_0_0 and 2_0_0--draco has
	the following packages:

		level 1: ds++ stdheaders
		level 2: xm rng c4 units traits UnitTestFrame cdi
		level 3: timestep pcgWrap stopwatch quadrature radphys
			 ConjGrad meshReaders viz cdi_eospac 
			 cdi_gandolf cdi_analytic
		level 4: RTT_Format_Reader
		level 5: mc meshReaders_Services
		level 6: imc

	* pcgWrap: changed linalg to pcgWrap.  Released pcgWrap-1_0_0.
	This is a temporary package because pcg is no longer supported at
	the lab.  It will be superceded in the near future.

	* config: build-system improvements.  Notably, cleaned up vendor
	stuff--added with-lapack, with-gandolf, with-pcg, removed
	with-pcglib.

2000-05-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* draco/: Released draco version draco-1_0_0.  This version
	contains the following sub-directories:

		src/
		doc/
		templates/
		autodoc/

	It contains the following packages under draco/:

		config-1_2_0
		tools-1_0_0

	It contains the following packages under draco/src/:

		mesh-1_8_0
		meshReaders-1_0_0
		imc-1_3_0
		mc-1_2_0
		rng-1_3_0
		c4-1_3_0
		viz-1_0_0 
		timestep-1_2_0
		xm-1_2_0
		stopwatch-1_1_0
		matprops-1_4_0
		nml-1_2_0
		UnitTestFrame-1_0_0
		traits-1_3_0
		diffusion-1_3_0
		radphys-1_4_0
		units-1_3_0
		ds++-1_3_0
		P1Diffusion-1_5_0
		ConjGradDiffusionSolver-1_0_0
		ConjGrad-1_0_0
		meshTest-1_2_0

	All regression tests in these packages passed on mikonos utilizing 
	the following configuration:

		draco_config .. --with-c4=mpi 
		--with-mpi-inc=/usr/local/mpich/include 
		--with-mpi-lib=/usr/local/mpich/lib 
		--with-sprng-inc=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/include 
		--with-sprng-lib=/usr/local/vendors/sprng/lib

	KCC 3.4g (LINUX) was used as the compiler.  See Memo
	X-6:00-22(U). For details.

	* templates: update templates to 1_1_0, added ChangeLog file to
 	templates directory.  In the future, each package in draco that
	maintains its own numbered release tag, autodoc, templates,
	config, c4, ds++, etc. should have their own ChangeLog files to
	record package-wide changes.  The draco ChangeLog will only record 
	draco-specific changes, releases, etc.  Of course, developers
	should feel free to "mirror" any changes noted in the individual
	package ChangeLogs to the draco ChangeLogs.  Even comments such
	as, "made changes in templates" are effective, as a user could
	simply peruse the templates ChangeLog file to see actual changes
	made. 

1999-09-03  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
	document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
	to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
	documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
	gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
	Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
	and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
	target yet.

	* src (all directories): initial release.
