	* templates: update templates to 1_1_0, added ChangeLog file to
 	templates directory.  In the future, each package in draco that
	maintains its own numbered release tag, autodoc, templates,
	config, c4, ds++, etc. should have their own ChangeLog files to
	record package-wide changes.  The draco ChangeLog will only record 
	draco-specific changes, releases, etc.  Of course, developers
	should feel free to "mirror" any changes noted in the individual
	package ChangeLogs to the draco ChangeLogs.  Even comments such
	as, "made changes in templates" are effective, as a user could
	simply peruse the templates ChangeLog file to see actual changes
	made.

	* autodoc, Makefile.in: added autodoc directory for automatic
	document generation.  added gmake autodoc target that runs doxygen 
	to build the documentation in the installation directory.  The
	documentation is built in the html and latex directories.  Running 
	gmake autodoc automatically does an install of the documentation.
	Running gmake clean will remove the documentation files from html
	and latex.  Note that no dependencies have been added to this
	target yet.
