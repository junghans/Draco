  <title>Access to the Source Code</title>

  <para>Draco is currently under CVS configuration management. The repository
  is on the CCS-4 network. In the near future we plan on moving the repository
  to the SourceForge server at LANL. To gain access to the source code you
  will need a computer account on the CCS-4 LAN and you must be made a member
  of the <filename>radtran</filename> Unix file sharing group. You may need to
  work with your line manager and/or the CCS system administrators to gain
  access to these computer systems.</para>

  <para>Draco can be checked out from the repository by:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Setting the environment variable \c CVS_RSH to \c ssh;</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Issuing the following checkout command:<programlisting>&gt; cvs -d sixhitch::codes/radtran/cvsroot co -P draco</programlisting></para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>If your workstation mounts <filename>/codes/radtran </filename>you do
  not need to include sixhitch: as a part of the path. Optionally, you can set
  the environment variable CVSROOT to the the string shown in the example
  above. In this case, you can omit the argument flag and value that specifies
  the repository location.</para>
