	* ac_dracoenv.m4 (AC_DBS_STLPORT_ENV): Remove settings for use of
	  optimized STLPort.  There appear to be problems with the
	  initialization of std::map containers in the optimized version.
	  In particular, Trilinos Teuchos doesn't function when built
	  against the optimized version of STLPort.

	* ac_platforms (AC_DBS_COMPAQ_F90_ENVIRONMENT):  For OSF1,
	  encapsulate FORTRAN related compiler flags and variables into a
	  M4 function -- similar to what has already been done for Linux.
	  Also, define some new configure variables for F90 related setup
	  (F90FLAGS, F90MPIFLAGS, F90CXXFLAGS, F90VENDOR_LIBS).  These are
	  currently used by Capsaicin.
