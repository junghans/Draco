	* ac_instrument.m4: This new configure file provides macro
	  functions for setting up a build that uses one or more of the
	  following instrumenting tools: STLPort, BullseyeCoverage or
	  PurifyPlus. 

	  Use STLPort 	[only available for g++ on Linux]:
	
	  --with-stlport[=dir]

	  If [=dir] is not provided, configure checks the value of
	  $STLPORT_BASE_DIR.  If this environment variable is empty it
	  tries to use /codes/radtran/vendors/stlport/Linux.

          Use Coverage Tool   [only available for g++ on Linux]:
	
	  --with-coverage[=bullseye(default)|gcov]

	  Examines the value of $COVERAGE_BASE_DIR to determine location
	  of coverage tool.  If this environment variable is not set,
	  configure will look at /usr/local/bullseye.

	  Support for gcov is not implemented at this time.

	  Use Memory Checking   [only available for g++ on Linux]:
	
	  --with-memory-check[=purify(default)|insure]

	  This option is stubbed out for now.  I would like to provide a
	  capability to configure for PurifyPlus or Insure++ using a
	  format similar to that provided for STLPort and
	  BullseyeCoverage.	 
	
	* ac_platforms.m4 (AC_DBS_LAHEY_ENVIRONMENT): Modify the checks
	  for $CXX = g++ so that it ignores leading path information.

	* ac_platforms.m4 (AC_DBS_LINUX_ENVIRONMENT): For g++, add
	  -pthread to $CXXFLAGS if --with-trilinos or --with-stlport is
	  specified. 

	* ac_dracoenv.m4 (AC_DRACO_ENV): Move STLPort related functions to
	  ac_instrument.m4.  Replace call to AC_DBS_STLPORT_ENV with a
	  call to AC_DRACO_INSTR_ENV that is provided in the file
	  ac_instrument.m4.  

	* ac_dracoarg.m4 (AC_DRACO_ARGS): Replace help string for
	  --with-stlport by a call to AC_DRACO_INSTR_ARGS.  This new macro
	  function provides help strings for the instrumenting options
	  provided in the new config file ac_instrument.m4.

	* ac_compiler.m4 (AC_CPP_ENV): In the check for --with-cxx=pgi,
	  modify the test that checks $CXX = pgCC so that it ignores
	  leading path information.

	* ac_dracoenv.m4 (AC_DBS_STLPORT_ENV): Remove settings for use of
	  optimized STLPort.  There appear to be problems with the
	  initialization of std::map containers in the optimized version.
	  In particular, Trilinos Teuchos doesn't function when built
	  against the optimized version of STLPort.

	* ac_platforms (AC_DBS_COMPAQ_F90_ENVIRONMENT):  For OSF1,
	  encapsulate FORTRAN related compiler flags and variables into a
	  M4 function -- similar to what has already been done for Linux.
	  Also, define some new configure variables for F90 related setup
	  (F90FLAGS, F90MPIFLAGS, F90CXXFLAGS, F90VENDOR_LIBS).  These are
	  currently used by Capsaicin.
