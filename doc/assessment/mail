Mark,

I reviewed the work plan and it looks like
there isn't that much that can be stripped out.

Option 1 - As planned           : 218 man-weeks = 4.36 man-years @ 50 wks/year

Option 2 - w/o debugging efforts: 134 man-weeks = 2.68 man-years @ 50 wks/year

Geoff had elaborate plans to make every object dump its state, etc.
for debug/restart purposes, I don't see where we can really do that
now, thus Option 2.

In short, it's a little higher than we thought, mainly because some
of the stuff that I was thinking would be TYCHO specific really does
belong to DRACO. So take your pick, anything in the 
3 to 4 man-year range is not unreasonable in my book..........
