\section{Overview}

As mentioned previously, \imctest\ is built under \draco.  \draco\ is a
\cpp\ framework which provides a general structure for building
computational physics codes.  It's purpose is organizational as
opposed to being a hard and fast framework.  The principle \draco\ services
used by \imctest\ include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \dspp, a \cpp\ services package that includes \comp{SP} (smart
  pointer), \comp{Mat} (matrix), and \comp{Assert} classes;
\item \cccc, a \cpp\ communications interface package that allows
  concise message passing using MPI.
\end{itemize}
In addition, \draco\ maintains a multifunctional build model which
performs explicit instantiation of template classes efficiently.

The underlying principle of \draco\ is the development of transport
libraries which are parameterized on mesh-types (MT).  In \cpp\ this
means defining class templates which may be parameterized on (nearly)
any MT.  \imctest\ follows this organizational principle.
