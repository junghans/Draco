\begin{abstract}
  
  The \imctest\ code is an Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) code based upon
  the Fleck and Cummings~\cite{fl71} method.  \imctest\ is part of the
  \jayenne\ project; the package is an intermediate stage towards the
  development of \milagro. The \jayenne\ project is developed under
  \draco\ within the Transport Methods group.  The \imctest\ package
  utillizes simplified physics including one-frequency, no Compton
  scattering, and two temperatures (material and radiation).  In
  addition, the \imctest\ works only in stand-alone mode on $xy$ and
  $xyz$ orthogonal-structured meshes.  No coupling to hydrodynamics is
  included in the package.  \imctest\ is written in \cpp\ based on an
  extensible design which should allow simple migration to \milagro.
