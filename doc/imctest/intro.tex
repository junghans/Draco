\section{Introduction}

The \imctest package represents a first step towards the development
of \milagro.  In this sense, \imctest may be considered an early
release of \milagro.  The goals of \imctest are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item develop an extensible C++ object-oriented/generic design;
\item test the implementation of the IMC algorithm on several simple
  test problems;
\item test the parallel performance of IMC on several platforms.
\end{enumerate}
The object-oriented/generic design of \imctest will ensure an easy
transition to the full \milagro package.  The improvements and
additions that are required to promote \imctest to \milagro include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item interfaces to various host-codes;
\item improved physics;
\item new mesh types and geometries;
\end{enumerate}
