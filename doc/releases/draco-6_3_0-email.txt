Release of Draco-6_3_0

Draco has been updated to version 6_3_0 and is tied to the release of
Jayenne-6_1_0.  This release was completed on the following
platfoms/toolsets: 

Platform      Compiler          MPI              .
TU/HU/TY      Intel 10.0.023    OpenMPI-1.4.3
HU            PGI-9.0-3         OpenMPI-1.4.3
CT/CI         PGI 10.9.0        MPICH2-5.2.0.7
Roadrunner    GCC-4.3.0         OpenMPI-1.4.3

Summary of changes:
   
 * The pcgWrap component has been retired.
 * The cdi_gandolf component has been retired and replaced with the
   new cdi_ipcress component. The new component can read IPCRESS
   opacity files without linking to the gandolf library and provides
   IPCRESS support for platforms where gandolf is not available
   (CI/CT, Mac OS/X). 
 * The build system has been updated to provide preliminary support
   for CUDA/GPU and OpenMPI programming and software instrumentation
   with the PAPI libraries. 
 * Requires CMake-2.8.6 or newer. 
   * Improved vendor library discover.
   * Improved support for XCode and Eclipse/CDT.

 * The c4 and rng libraries were updated to provide support for
   int64_t (long long int) data types. 
 * The c4 gatherv/scatterv routines were updated to provide support
   for vector<char> and std::string. 
 * device/GPU_Device has been provided as a prototype wrapper for CUDA
   calls. 

A more complete list of changes can be found in the ChangeLog. 

Known issues:

 * 4 source files score less than 50% for code coverage
   (coder.lanl.gov/cdash). 
 * A potential memory leak is reported in
   parser/tstAbstract_Class_Parser. 
 * tstOMP fails on CT/CI.

Please direct your questions or concerns to myself or the Draco team
(draco@lanl.gov).
