Dear Colleagues and Customers,

I have released Draco-6_2_0.  This is a minor release that includes one new component (device), a few bug fixes, new build system features and updated environment files.  This release is required for the upcoming release of Jayenne-6_0_0.  The release was completed using the new CMake-based build system and may not be compatible with Draco clients still using the autoconf-based build system.  The following components are not provided with this release: plot2D, cdi_eospac and pcgWrap.

This release is available at /usr/projects/draco/draco-6_2_0 on:
	Yellowrail/Redtail
	Turing/Hurricane
	Cielito/Cielo (some packages were not installed due to missing vendor dependencies)
	rr-dev-fe/Roadrunner

Full details can be found in the ChangeLog from the source code and in the attached release note.  Items of interest are:
	The ‘device’ component has been added for this release.  This package encapsulates a DACS_Process for codes that run on the cell processor.
	The ‘xm’ component has been retired.
	The regression dashboard is at http://coder.lanl.gov/cdash.  You can sign up for regression email from this web site.  The dashboard also reports code coverage statistics and valgrind memory analysis.
	Demonstrated support for Xcode on OS/X (Generator == “Xcode”) and Eclipse CDT on Linux (Generator == “Eclipse CDT4  Unix Makefiles”). 
	Demonstrated support for cross compiling on Cielito and Roadrunner via CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE feature.
	C4 now contains the package ‘path.hh’ that provides some filesystem path functions.
	C4 now contains the function ‘send_is’
	Parts of cdi_analytic have been updated.  Some classes/files have been renamed.
	cdi_gandolf now provides the utility GandolfInterpreter to interactively query ipcress files. 
	Two packages from ds++ were retired: Allocators and DynArray.
	The quadrature component had several improvements to support Capsaicin.
	An exponential integral function capability was added to the special_functions component.
	The traits component is now a header-only component.  A library is no longer created or installed.
	Draco ‘Modules’ support expanded to support most LANL machines.

tf.lanl.gov indicates there are 6 known defects/feature requests in the current release.  Twelve defects (listed on Draco’s page on http://tf.lanl.gov) were resolved for this release. Code coverage and lines-of-code statistics, component levelization diagram and quick start tutorials can be found in the attached memo.

Sincerely,
