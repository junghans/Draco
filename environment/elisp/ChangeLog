	* (draco-setup-auctex-mode): Remove keybinding for \C-c \C-c
	because it hides other useful LaTeX key bindings.  Instead, use
	\C-c % to comment a selected region.

2005-05-27  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* draco-mode.el: Improve highlighting of m4 divider by adding a
	space between dnl and the first dash.
	
	* draco-config-modes.el (draco-setup-auctex-mode): Turn on
	draco-mode and auto-fill by default when bibtex-mode starts.  

2005-05-23  Kelly Thompson <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* all_files: Major rewrite of all Draco elisp scripts.  See README
  	  file for details about usage.

2004-11-30  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* ccs4defaults.el: Moved defvar code to top of file so that
	  ccs4-elisp-dir doesn't get clobbered.

	* fl-keywords.el: Updated code that fontifies Draco DbC
	  keywords. This hack is not 100% what Tom and I wanted.  It does
	  fontify the DbC keywords -- including when these keywords are
	  used in a comment block.

	* Config-pkg.el (draco-init-cc-mode): Add hook by default so that
	  DbC keywords are highlighted by font-lock.

	* Config-pkg.el: Changed a few setq comands to defvar commands to
	  reduce the number of warnings about undefined variables when
	  byte-compiling this file.

2004-11-12  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* ccs4defaults.el: Simplified the mechanism for including this
	  file.  Updated the comments to reflect this change.  Now, we
	  only need to add the following command to users's
	  .xemacs/init.el file:

	  (load-library "/path/to/draco/environment/elisp/ccs4defaults.el")

	* ccs4defaults.el (ccs4-env-dirs): New variable that contains a
	  list of directories where Draco elisp code might be found.  This
	  list is parsed to setup the CCS-4 elisp environment.

	* ccs4defaults.el: de-select doxymacs-mode if doxymacs.el is not
	  found. 

	* ccs4defaults.el: Moved setup of Info-directory-list to
	  xemacs-setup.el. 

	* xemacs-setup.el: Update elisp that sets the Info-directory-list
  	  environment.  Also, comment out some gmf code that is not being
	  used.

2004-09-22  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* Config-pkg.el: By default, turn on doxymacs-mode. The doxymacs
	  package is available as a part of draco/environment/elisp on
	  open ICN machines and on the CCS-2/4 LAN. Also fixed declaration
	  of doxymacs-doxygen-style so this script doesn't overwrite a
	  value set by the user. 

2004-08-04  Kelly Thompson  <kgt@lanl.gov>

	* rtt-hacks.el (rtt-companion-alist): Added the pairs (.hh;.i.hh)
	  and (.i.hh;.hh).  This allows C-f8 to map between hh and
	  i.hh files when a .cc file is not available. Added some
	  documentation.  

	* ccs4defaults.el ((not (file-installed-p "doxymacs.el"))): Add
	  elisp code to turn off want-doxymacs-mode if doxymacs.el is not
	  available.  

	* Config-pkg.el (draco-init-cvs-mode): Added global key binding
	  for M-S-f5 to run 'cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window.
	  This function is only defined if pcl-cvs has been loaded. 

	* Config-key.el (global-map): Added key mapping for C-S-f5 to run
	  add-change-log-entry.
