	* Config-pkg.el: By default, turn on doxymacs-mode. The doxymacs
	  package is available as a part of draco/environment/elisp on
	  open ICN machines and on the CCS-2/4 LAN. Also fixed declaration
	  of doxymacs-doxygen-style so this script doesn't overwrite a
	  value set by the user.

	* rtt-hacks.el (rtt-companion-alist): Added the pairs (.hh;.i.hh)
	  and (.i.hh;.hh).  This allows C-f8 to map between hh and
	  i.hh files when a .cc file is not available. Added some
	  documentation.  

	* ccs4defaults.el ((not (file-installed-p "doxymacs.el"))): Add
	  elisp code to turn off want-doxymacs-mode if doxymacs.el is not
	  available.  

	* Config-pkg.el (draco-init-cvs-mode): Added global key binding
	  for M-S-f5 to run 'cvs-mode-add-change-log-entry-other-window.
	  This function is only defined if pcl-cvs has been loaded. 

	* Config-key.el (global-map): Added key mapping for C-S-f5 to run
	  add-change-log-entry.
