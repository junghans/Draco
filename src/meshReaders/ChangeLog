	* Hex_Mesh_Reader.hh: Modified constructor to make it explicit. We
	  don't want std::strings being converted intto Hex_Mesh_Readers
	  implicitly.  

2002-05-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* meshReaders: updated to version 1_4_0. This release is primarily
	for the new testing.

2002-03-26  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* meshReaders/test: removed dependence on UnitTestFrame.  Now uses
	standard draco testing infrastructure.

	* meshReaders: released version 1_3_0.  This release no longer
	includes the configure script within the package.

2001-07-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* meshReaders: released version 1_2_0.  New accessors added to
	interface.

	* meshReaders: released version meshReaders-1_1_0. Using
	UnitTestFrame-1_1_0, which has a non-C4 option, we have
	reorganized meshReaders so that it no longer depends on C4 as part 
	of its levelization.  This is correct because meshReaders is an
	inherently scalar package, and it should not have to depend on C4
	just because it uses UnitTestFrame.
