	* test/tQuadServices.cc: Added tests for factorial and
	kronecker_delta now that they are public accessible; Add
	independent verification tests for computing some of the values of
	M and D; Now test 1D, 2D and 3D quadrature sets.

	* autodoc/QuadServices.dcc: Added more Associated Legendre
	polynomial's to the existing list.

	* QuadServices_pt.cc (class QuadServices): Moved 
	kronecker_delta() and factorial() to namespace scope and out of
	the class definition. 

	* QuadServices.i.hh (class QuadServices): Moved kronecker_delta() 
	and factorial() to namespace scope and out of the class
	definition. 

	* QuadServices.hh (class QuadServices): Moved kronecker_delta()
	and factorial() to namespace scope and out of the class
	definition. 

	* QuadServices.hh (class QuadServices): Added an accessor function
	to retrieve the n2lk values (the mapping between moment n and the
	spherical harmonic index tuple (l,k)).

	* QuadServices.cc (spherical_harmonic): Fixed two bugs.
	1) For 2D quadratures, initialize xi = sqrt(1-mu^2-eta^2).
	2) When computing the spherical harmonic value, the argument to
  	   cos() should read k*azimuthalAngle.

	* quadrature: release 1_2_0.  Std conforming updates to
	Quadrature.cc.

2002-05-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* quadrature: released version 1_1_0.  This is the second
	"official" release of this package.  From the first release it
	includes the new draco testing framework.
