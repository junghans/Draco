	* xm: release 1_5_0.  Added std:: compliance to applicative.hh
	(abs functions are ANSI C defined in stdlib).  Put explicit base
	class scoping in the test/UserVec.hh class.  This should not be
	required, but it is a workaround for the Compaq CXX 6.5.0
	compiler (it is not incorrect to scope anyway).
