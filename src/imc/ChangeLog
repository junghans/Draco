	* Comm_Builder.*:  Updated the Comm_Builder class to use
	rtt_mc::Topology to build instances of the Communicator class.
	This class is now ready for release for a full DD supported
	version of imc.

	* test/tstCommunicator.*: Added full testing for the Communicator
	and Comm_Builder classes.

2000-06-07  Todd J. Urbatsch  <tmonster@lanl.gov>

	* DD_Source_Builder.*: Added derived class for building the imc
 	source on a full domain decomposition topology.

2000-04-19  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* DD_Transporter.*: Full and General DD class to handle a single
	timestep of IMC F&C transport on domain decomposed parallel mesh
	topologies.

2000-04-18  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Transporter.*, Rep_Transporter.*: Transporter class to handle a
	single timestep of IMC F&C transport.

	* imc: Updated to version imc-1_3_0.  This still does not have
	complete DD functionality.  Version 2_0_0 will include complete
	DD.  Version 1_3_0 has complete functionality for full
	replication.

2000-02-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Source_Init.*, Interface.hh: updated these classes to reflect
	the new mesh builder model.  In this model the mesh builder reads
	its own mesh format file.  Thus, Source_Init is not required to
	calculate surface source cells; this is now taken care of by the
	mesh builder class.

	* test, IMC_Test.hh, OS_Input.in: updated tests to reflect the new
 	builder model.  Added a mesh format file for testing
	(OS_Input.in).  Also, updated IMC_Test.hh so that is now contains
	a parser (gives the interface the name of the mesh file) and an
	interface, which uses the mesh builder to get certain data (like
	the list of surface cells).

2000-01-19  Todd J. Urbatsch  <tmonster@lanl.gov>

	* Rep_Source_Builder.t.hh: Corrected a long-time error: after
 	sampling the initial census, ecen(cell) should (and now does)
 	represent the energy of the actual particles.  (ecentot still
 	represents the deterministically calculated total census energy,
 	though.)  Thus, ecentot - global_ecen_loss = true ecentot.  This
 	change will need to be carried into DD_Source_Builder, etc.  The
 	old error was in the old Source_Init and old Parallel_Source_Init
 	(pre v2_0_0).

2000-01-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Source_Init.*: removed the old Source_Init.  The new Source_Init 
	does pre-initialization source initialization.  This includes
	evaluating surface source cells and estimating source numbers as a 
	precursor to parallel partitioning.  The new Source_Init requires
	a full mesh.  At present it only calculates the surface source
	cells.  Source number calculations will not be necessary until we
	go to a general/DD topology.

1999-12-20  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Mesh_Operations.*: added Mesh_Operations class.  This class is
	template on MT and provides specializations to different MTs for
	operations that perform highly mesh-centric operations on data.
	For example, we use this class to perform T4 slope sampling
	because each MT may do this sampling differently but it requires
	communication and temperature data, which are outside the pervue
	of the mesh, to do the sampling itself.  Essentially, this is a
	mesh association class for IMC operations that do highly mesh-like 
	things.

1999-11-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Opacity_Builder.hh, Opacity_Builder.t.hh, Particle_Buffer.hh:
	first of many modifications that will result in full parallel
	sourcing and opacity reading.  These changes are heading towards
	release imc-2_0_0.  All of the imc tests should still pass at this 
	point.

1999-11-12  Todd J. Urbatsch  <tmonster@lanl.gov>

	* : Updated to imc-1_2_0. 

1999-11-10  Todd J. Urbatsch  <tmonster@lanl.gov>

	* Global_Tally.t.hh, Global_Tally.hh, Source_Init.t.hh,
	Source_Init.hh: 1) Corrected Initial Material Energy Edit 2) Added 
	material volume source -- time-explicit portion. 

1999-10-15  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Parallel_Source_Init.hh, Parallel_Source_Init.t.hh,
	Source_Init.hh, Source_Init.t.hh:  Added expanded surface source
	capability.  Updated to imc-1_1_0.
