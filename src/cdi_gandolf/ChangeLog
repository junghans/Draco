	* cdi_gandolf: released cdi_gandolf-1_1_0.  This release updates
	cdi_gandolf to the specification defined by cdi-1_1_0.  It also
	(as noted below) removes UnitTestFrame from tests.

	* GandolfGrayOpacity, GandolfMultigroupOpacity: adding
	packing/unpacking functionality for persistence.

	* cdi_gandolf: removed dependency to UnitTestFrame from
	cdi_gandolf.  Cleaned up the template members of
	GandolfGrayOpacity and GandolfMultigroupOpacity.  The template
	members are now defined in the headers so automatic instantiation
	is easier.  We are not ready to release cdi_gandolf-1_1_0 yet.  We
	will wait until it has been implemented into the milagro package.
