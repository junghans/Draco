	* Algorithms.hh, Nestmap.*, Sort.*, SortPermutation.*, String.*,
	isSorted.hh, opaquePointers.*: These classes/files have been
	removed.  With the STL they are not needed.  Coming soon,
	refactoring of Mat that will allow us to remove Allocator, etc.

	* ds++: release 1_8_0.  Fixed some problems with standard
	conformity in tstSort.cc.  Fixed test of tstPacking_Utils.cc.
	There was a vague implicit conversion there in which space for
	ints was allocated, but the loaded type was not guaranteed to be
	an int.

2002-11-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ds++: Updated to 1_7_0.  Small std compliant changes to
	SortPermutation. 

2002-05-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ds++: updated to release ds++-1_6_0.  This release primarily
	consists of fixes for compilers.

2001-12-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ds++: updated to release ds++-1_5_0.  This release contained a
	new header, Soft_Equivalence.hh, which is used for floating point
	comparisons.  It also contains some fixes to Packing_Utils and
	improved testing infrastructure using the new draco testing
	templates (although not all tests were updated this way).

	Also, configure is no longer part of the ds++ package.  It is
	built by src/configure.

2001-07-25  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ds++: updated to release ds++-1_4_0.  This release contains the
	Packing_Utils components. It also cleans up some other
	classes--adds namespace declarations, etc--to that gnu g++ can
	compile ds++.

2000-02-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ., test: updated to release ds++-1_1_0.  This release primarily
 	takes into account the namespace change from dsxx:: to rtt_dsxx::
 	Namespaces are now consistent in ds++. Also, some new functions
 	(Check_Strings) have been added.

2000-04-19  Shawn Pautz  <pautz@lanl.gov>

	updated to release ds++-1_3_0 (not sure when ds++-1_2_0 happened.
	We have removed the last_stable tag and the dejagnu scripts.
