	* ds++: updated to release ds++-1_5_0.  This release contained a
	new header, Soft_Equivalence.hh, which is used for floating point
	comparisons.  It also contains some fixes to Packing_Utils and
	improved testing infrastructure using the new draco testing
	templates (although not all tests were updated this way).
