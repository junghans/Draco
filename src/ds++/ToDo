Things that need to be done to improve the C++ Data Structures Library.

1.  There appears to be no way to reset a list iterator (like to the
    beginning, for example, so you can reuse it).

2.  List iterators don't deal well with empty lists.  Should throw an
    exception. 

3.  Lots of the classes need to be cleaned up to work with autodoc
    better.

4.  Autodoc needs embellishement to correctly deal with the many
    advanced syntactic constructs in ds++.

5.  Figure out how to do template preinstantiation, and whether it
    helps compile time, etc.  So far things are looking pretty grisly.
    Total failure on HP/UX, for instance.  Got to get a handle on
    this.
