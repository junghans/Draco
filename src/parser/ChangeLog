	* Console_Token_Stream.cc (Rewind): Add an additional DbC check on
	  the value of cin.rdstate() to ensure a clean exit.

	* configure.ac (Dependencies): This package now depends on units.

	* Rename files <file>.inp.in to <file>.inp.  Update configure.ac
	  and Makefile.target so that the make command copies input files
	  to the test directory instead of configure.

	* driver4tstConsole_Token_Stream.cc (runtest): Execute
	  tstConsole_Token_Stream in scalar mode.  It does not make sense
	  to execute this test in parallel and it fails on some
	  architecture/mpi combinations.  Remove all inclusion of c4 or
	  mpi directives and functions.

	* tstConsole_Token_Stream.cc: Make executable scalar -- removing
	  all references to c4 or mpi.

	* Move the parser package from Capsaicin to Draco.

	* Parallel_File_Token_Stream.cc (Parallel_File_Token_Stream):
	Moved initialization of member is_io_processor away from the
	contructor body and into the initializer list.

	* File_Token_Stream.cc: Add an open function to attach a different
	file to the File_Token_Stream, by analogy with the open function
	of standard library character streams.

	* Text_Token_Stream.hh: Modify character buffering so that a block
	of characters can be added to the buffer simultaneously.  This
	better supports Parallel_File_Token_Stream by allowing a sizeable
	block of characters to be communicated across processors.

2003-03-18  Kent Budge  <kgbudge@tresosos.lanl.gov>

	* Text_Token_Stream.hh: Fix a couple bugs and add the ability to 
	scan C and C++ comments as white space.
