	* Move the parser package from Capsaicin to Draco.

	* Parallel_File_Token_Stream.cc (Parallel_File_Token_Stream):
	Moved initialization of member is_io_processor away from the
	contructor body and into the initializer list.

2003-07-14  Kent Budge  <kgbudge@tresosos.lanl.gov>

	* File_Token_Stream.cc: Add an open function to attach a different
	file to the File_Token_Stream, by analogy with the open function
	of standard library character streams.

2003-06-25  Kent Budge  <kgbudge@tresosos.lanl.gov>

	* Text_Token_Stream.hh: Modify character buffering so that a block
	of characters can be added to the buffer simultaneously.  This
	better supports Parallel_File_Token_Stream by allowing a sizeable
	block of characters to be communicated across processors.

2003-03-18  Kent Budge  <kgbudge@tresosos.lanl.gov>

	* Text_Token_Stream.hh: Fix a couple bugs and add the ability to 
	scan C and C++ comments as white space.
