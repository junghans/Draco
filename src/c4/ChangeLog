2003-03-13  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to version 2_3_0.  This has some improvements made
	by lowrie to the Timer class.

2002-11-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to version 2_2_0.  This change added flags to
	config.h for the Compaq ALASKA MPI release.

2002-08-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to version 2_1_0.  This change added full support
	for duplicating and freeing communicators.

2002-05-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to version 2_0_0.  This release encompasses the
	changes from 25-MAR-02.  C4 is now in a state where we can begin
	to add new functionality (UPS, Gather/Scatters, etc ). This
	release has basic testing, but could use more.  Additionally, it
	still supports old C4 namespace backwards-compatibility.  However,
	nothing new will be added to this namespace.

2002-03-25  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: massive changes.  Removed support for nx and shmem.  Added
	all services to the rtt_c4 namespace (C4 namespace is preserved in
	global.hh for backwards compatibility).  This first major series
	of changes preserves the same capabilities as before--albeit with
	different names.  c4 can be implemented serially and on mpi.  UPS
	should be easy to add now.  For those of you who want to work in
	the old C4 namespace, checkout c4-1_6_0.  No new functions will be
	added to the C4 namespace.  All new stuff is to be added to
	rtt_c4.  For the time-being, the C4 namespace will be preserved
	for a transition period.

	To summarize, you don't have to do anything just now; however, you
	should think about migrating to rtt_c4 namespace (the function
	names have changed as well).  The old C4 namespace, with the old
	function declarations, is still preserved in global.hh.

2001-12-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to c4-1_6_0.  The only change in this release is
	that configure is no longer part of the package.

2001-07-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to c4-1_5_0.  This release adds the ParallelUtils
	component.  It also adds type long to the mpi_traits list.  Some
	antiquated files are removed.

2000-12-14  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: Updated to c4-1_4_0.  This release is primarily due to
	R. Roberts enhancements to (C4_Req). These enhancements were
	performed on 3-JUN-00.  They added full reference counting to the
	(C4_Req) class.

2000-04-18  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* c4: update to release c4-1_3_0.  This release removed all
	deprecated dejagnu references.

2000-02-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* ., test: updated release to c4-1_2_0.  This updates c4 to the
	new ds++ namespace.  We will modernize the c4 namespace at a later 
	date when we work on c4 next.
