	* Added write_part() function, which allows writing on a per-part
	basis.  This way, parallel dumps may be done on a per-processor
	basis, as opposed to collecting all data on a single processor
	before dumping.  A "part" is what ensight_dump() refers to as a 
	"region."  The part nomenclature follows the ensight
	documentation.

	* Lots of internal code rearrangement.

2004-11-15  Rob Lowrie  <lowrie@lanl.gov>

	* Switched to Enight Gold format.  Added option to dump binary
	ensight files.  Note that the tests for binary format need more
	work (see tstEnsight_Translator.cc).

2003-05-06  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Ensight_Translator: got rid of constructors where the dump_times
	are arguments; these were confusing and they were causing trouble
	on the IBM platforms because of a bug in xlC.  Now there is one
	simple constructor available that allows you to overwrite the
	existing ensight directory.  The default is to append, not
	overwrite.

2002-05-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* viz: released version 1_3_0.  Updated Ensight_Translator to
	produce the same outputting with gcc as with KCC.

2001-12-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* viz: release version 1_2_0.  This release no longer includes
	configure scripts in the package.  Also, it contains R. Lowrie's
	updates to Ensight_Translator that allows the translator to parse
	case files on restarts instead of requiring the dump times to be
	stored. 

2001-07-30  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* viz: released version 1_1_0.  Added std:: namespace to
	(Ensight_Translator) that allows compiling by g++.

2000-04-18  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* viz: released version 1_0_0 of viz.

2000-01-26  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Ensight_Translator.*, Release.*, configure.*: Added first
	version of an ensight translator for draco.
