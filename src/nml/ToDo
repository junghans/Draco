1. If a callback modifies the set of blocks, or items in a block,
   chaos can result.  We need this ability, so it should not be
   dissabled.  But need to think of a way to prevent inconsistent
   situations.  For example, if a block is removed after the blocks
   window is up, then certainly we should refuse to pop up the block,
   and maybe we should somehow dynamically change the interface.  Have
   to give this some serious thought.
