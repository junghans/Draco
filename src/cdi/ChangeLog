	* CDI: added Planck integration routines.  These return the
	integrated, normalized Planck spectrum, b(x) where x = h\nu/kT.

	* cdi: updated cdi package to 1_0_0a.  We are not quite ready for
	release (1_1_0) yet.  This includes some changes that should
	prepare cdi for integration into a real physics package.
