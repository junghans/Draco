	* test/tCDI.cc: Adding tests to improve code coverage. 
	  - Call the member function integrateRosselandSpectrum(igroup, T)
	    and compare the result to the result of
 	    integrateRosselandSpectrum(low,high,T).
	  - Provide material name for the cdi constructor.  Call member
	    function getMatID() and compare result to initializer
	    argument. 
	  - Call release() and print the version info to stdout.

	* CDI.cc: Modified the polylog evaluation of the Planck integral
	to make it considerably faster, at least on Linux platforms.

2003-07-18  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* CDI.hh, CDI.cc: committed P. Batcho's Rosseland integrator
	functions.  These functions provide analogs of the
	integratePlanckSpectrum functions.  The only function that is
	missing is an integration over all groups by simply giving the
	temperature. 

2002-05-08  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* cdi: Release 1_2_0.  Added some DBC to CDI for large-FP number
	checks.  STD compliance in the tests.

	* cdi: Planck function integrators now allow T=0 and, in which
	case, return zero.

2001-12-17  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* cdi: release version 1_1_0. Lots of updates since original
	release.  Several functions have been added to the GrayOpacity,
	MultigroupOpacity, and EoS base classes.  Planck integration
	routines have been added.  Packing functions have been added.  It
	no longer uses UnitTestFrame.

2001-11-26  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* GrayOpacity, EoS, MultigroupOpacity: added virtual function:

		virtual std::vector<char> pack() const = 0;

	to each class.  Thus, derived types will be able to pack
	themselves into char strings for persistence.  The drawback is
	that the client must know what derived type of GrayOpacity, etc
	class is packed to unpack them because the vector<char> should be
	given to a constructor of the appropriate derived type.

2001-11-09  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* CDI: added Planck integration routines.  These return the
	integrated, normalized Planck spectrum, b(x) where x = h\nu/kT.

2001-10-11  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* cdi: updated cdi package to 1_0_0a.  We are not quite ready for
	release (1_1_0) yet.  This includes some changes that should
	prepare cdi for integration into a real physics package.
