	* Refactor the design of cdi_eospac to be compatible with EOSPAC
  	  v6.2+.
	* Note: This is a minimal refactor to demonstrate how interact
	  with EOSPAC via CDI.  A redesign is almost certainly required
	  due to serious deficiencies in the current implementation.  This
	  refactor will be defered until someone actually needs to use the
	  EOS data.
	* Deficiencies:   Adding this block breaks Eospac as currently
	  implemented.  Effectively, the destructor for spEospacAlt
	  destroys all of the table handles for libeospac.  This is a flaw
	  in libeospac, but we may be forced to manage it in cdi_eospac by
	  using a Singleton Eospac object that uses reference counting for
	  each material+data tuple and calls eos_DestroyTables() instead
	  of eos_DestroyAll().  A redesign is also required to make this
	  package thread safe!

	* cdi_eospac: in release draco-4_2_0 cdi_eospac only works with
	the Lahey 6.0 F90 compiler.  configure.ac checks that lahey 6.0 is
	loaded and throws an error if not.  This is an issue with EOSPAC
	and not cdi_eospac.  It should be resolved when the next version
	of EOSPAC is release.  However, the new version will have a
	different interface that will require cdi_eospac refactoring.

	* cdi_eospac: release 1_2_0.  Fixes in configure.in for Compaq
	machine.

	* cdi_eospac: released version 1_1_0.  Updated to work with
	cdi-1_1_0 and greater.

	* physical_data: Eos data files (sesameu, sescu, sescu1, sescu9,
	sesou) are now located on the CCS-4 LAN.  To use cdi_eospac you
	will need to set the following environment variables to tell
	EOSPAC where the data files are:

	export SESPATHU=/codes/radtran/physical_data/eos
	export SESPATHC=/codes/radtran/physical_data/eos
