	* traits: updated to 1_5_0.  Changed ContainterTraits so that it
	was easier on compilers.  The conformal function in the default
	template referenced an undefined symbol.  This was done on purpose
	to make sure someone provided a specialization for a given type.
	The problem is that some compilers (Compaq cxx) check templates
	even though they are not compiled.  This IS a compiler error that
	has been reported.  To rectify, I added the function BogusMethod
	to the class template without defining it.  That way, cxx will
	find a valid symbol, but it conformal is attempted to be
	instantiated it will not find a definition for BogusMethod causing
	a link-time error.  Not as good as a compiler time error, but ok
	for now (until the compaq bug is fixed).

	* ., test: released version 1_2_0 of the traits package.  This
	change updates to the rtt_dsxx namespace.

	* .: released version 1_0_0 of the traits package.  Note that this 
	does require the current head version of configure.in because
	traits now depends on ds++ for assertion checking.

2000-01-21  Thomas M. Evans  <tme@lanl.gov>

	* Release.*, Viz_Traits.hh: added Release.hh and Release.cc to
	traits class to bring it up to speed.  Also added Viz_Traits for
	use with the viz package.
