\begin{KPAComment}
This is one of the most applicable KPAs that we do not do well.  We do
make some of the requirements explicit through software contracts
which are part of the specification, implementation, and testing of
the code, but we do poorly on formally developing the requirements,
reviewing them, and basing our plans on them.

\begin{KPAComment}
Our project team has taken the LANL traditional project management
course (Mastering Technical Projects) and we produce the standard
planning artifacts required by the ASCI program office.  However we
find these artifacts alone are inappropriate for managing software research
projects.  These plans provide poor maps for the actual software
project and are not useful for tracking.  We have contracted through
CIC--12 with True North pgs., Inc. to develop a project planning
strategy suitable for our work.

\Results{}
\end{KPARate}

\begin{KPAComment}
We have established requirements in the statement of work contracts,
we collect periodic reports, and hope to establish formal technical
reviews as a method of managing subcontractor work.

We feel it unrealistic to expect a group of our size to oversee the
software processes of our subcontractors.  Hence questions 4, 5, 10,
and 11 are not applicable to our team; we can envision the division SQA
and CM groups (if they existed!) performing these functions for us.

\end{KPARate}

\begin{KPAComment}
Currently the SQA and SE groups for Draco are one and the same.
We are planning to hire a dedicated SQA engineer and a dedicated
tester, who will, with our project planner form the SQA team for
X--TM.

We use design standards (Weinberg, Lakos, Meyer), coding standards
(ISO/IEC 14882, Meyers, POSIX, GNU), and testing standards (Analytic
Test Method, LA-UR-98-5735, LA-1709, LAMS-2421, LA-UR-96-1799) to
ensure the quality of our code.  We have contracted with Weinberg \&
Weinberg through CIC--12 to learn formal technical review techniques,
a key missing ingredient in our SQA, project oversight, and
verification efforts.
