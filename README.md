# Draco (LA-CC-16-016)
An object-oriented component library supporting radiation transport applications.
CCS-2 Computational Physics and Methods Group

Draco is an object-oriented component library geared towards
numerically intensive, radiation (particle) transport applications
built for parallel computing hardware.  It consists of
semi-independent packages and a robust build system.  The packages in
draco provide a set of components that can be used by multiple clients
to build transport codes.  The build system can also be extracted for
use in clients.

Draco contains two sets of components.  Active components are
currently used and maintained.  Retired packages are no longer in use
by any clients.  Retired packages can be recovered from subversion by
checking out a tagged version of a component or repository.
