<h3> <center> Introduction </center> </h3>

Welcome to the Web site of the Draco Computational Physics System.
We are part of the Computer and Computational Physics
Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This page contains links and other
useful information related to visiting our team and the local area.

<p>
Note that any listing of commercial establishments found below is provided for informational
purposes only. Such lists are not to be considered
complete, or to constitute any endorsement. Neither Los Alamos National
Laboratory nor the Draco team endorses any commercial establishments.



<hr>
<h3> <center> Draco Offices </center> </h3>
The majority of the team is located on the first floor of Building 422, Tech Area 3. 
Directions to this location can be found in the map section below. This is
"behind the fence" and visitors will require either an escort or a DOE security clearance
to obtain access to this building.

<h3> <center> Lodging </center> </h3>

<p> 
There are four commercial hotels in Los Alamos (Hilltop House, Los Alamos Inn, Holiday Inn Express
and the Bandalier Inn in White Rock). There are also several Bed and Breakfast establishments.
Details can be found at the


 <a href="http://www.vla.com/directory/lodging.htm">Virtual Los Alamos: Lodging </a>
site. Other sites listed below in the "General Information" section also contains links to 
housing information. Also, information for both
long and short term housing needs may be found at the
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/Internal/housing.html"> LANL Housing Page </a>.
Virtual Los Alamos also maintains a 
<a href="http://www.vla.com/housing/default.htm">housing page</a> for those interested
in long term accommodations.
<hr>
<h3> <center> Weather and Climate Information </center> </h3>

Los Alamos is situated on the Pajarito Plateau at the foot of the Jemez Mountains
 in Northern New Mexico.
Summertime highs are often in the 80-90F range, while winter highs are in the 30-40F range.
As a result of our high elevation (7400 feet), we often see a temperature drop of 30F or
 more over night,
so it is best to bring a jacket even in the summer. Those who are not accustomed to high
elevation are advised not to plan any strenuous physical activity for a few days after
their arrival.

</ul>
<hr>
<h3> <center> Books </center> </h3>
There are two bona-fide book stores in Los Alamos:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.otowi.com/otowi/"> Otowi Station Book Store </a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.rbooks.com/"> R Books </a>
</ul>
These stores have a variety of books on Los Alamos,the Southwest, local and lab history, hiking and mountain biking, as well
as USGS quality maps of the local area.
<hr>
<h3> <center> Parking </center> </h3>
In the past, 
parking has been  available in several large lots across Pajarito Road 100 yards west of Bldg 422. No special
permits are required. These lots show up as dark gray areas in the 
<a href="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/wthi?ta=3&bldg=422">location map</a>
for Bldg 422.
<p>
As of October 1999, the parking situation has deteriorated rapidly due to the
nearby construction of the Strategic Computing Complex. Many of the parking
lots historically available in the vicinity will be replaced by new buildings
soon. See <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/News/TA-3parking.html" >
Parking Areas Around TA-3 </a> and 
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/News/LABusRoute.pdf" > Parking Shuttle
Routes </a> for a snapshot as of 10 Feb 00. The situation can be expected
to change frequently with little or no notice over the next 12 months.

<h3> <center> Badges </center> </h3> 
If you need to visit the badge office to pick up a temporary badge or escort
papers, it is within walking distance of the Draco team offices. A map can be found
in the Map section above.

<h3> <center> Drop-in Office Space </center> </h3>
 Office space is at a premium in the vicinity of Draco team offices. Unfortunately, we have
no dedicated drop-in offices for our visitors and collaborators at this time.
 However, it is often possible to find people on
travel or vacation who are willing to let others use their offices for the short term.
Visitors in need of office space should coordinate through their individual Draco sponsor.

<hr>
<h3> <center> Access to E-mail, Internet, and Local Computing Resources  </center> </h3> 
Two steps are required to obtain access to our local area network. First you must obtain
a LANL Integrated Computer Network (ICN) account number.
 See the LANL ICN <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/Internal/divisions/cic/cic6/password.html">
 Password Office </a> for the necessary forms and additional information. Once you have
a ICN account, the CCS-Division
Computing Services Team will establish a visitor account for you. 

Your Draco sponsor
may be required to fill out certain account request forms on your behalf.
