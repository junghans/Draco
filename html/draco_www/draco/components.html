<h3> <center> Component Library </center> </h3>

This page and descendants describe the individual 
reusable components and services in the Draco system.
Each of these components is in use or anticipated to
be in use by two or more Draco client systems.
<p>
As of Feb 2000, the Draco component library
contained 33,940 logical lines of C++ code, 2,959
lines of Python, 506 lines of Perl and 2,970 lines
of Expect. In support
of this code are an additional 31,420 lines of comments,
10,750 lines of LaTeX-formated documentation, and 7,135
lines of HTML.


<dl>
<dt> <h4>  C4 Communication Library </h4>
<dd> Provides a type-safe interface to MPI or SHMEM based
communication procedures for use on parallel computer
architectures. 
<p>

<dt> <h4>  DS++ Services Library </h4>
<dd> Provides design-by-contract utilities, a smart-pointer utility, and
     a variety of simple container classes.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  XYZ Mesh Type </h4>
<dd> A simple orthogonal hexahedral mesh class for use in testing
     and development operations.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Analytic Material Properties </h4>
<dd> A material properties class that provides for calculation
of material properties using analytic
formulas. Useful for testing and development.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Multi-Material-Cell Material Properties </h4>
<dd> A Multi-Material Cell class based on a temperature equilibration
     model. Multi-material cells are pre-processed into a single
     homogenized material for input to a client transport package.
     Homogenized results from the transport package are mapped
     back to the original materials in a post-processing operation.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Time-Step Manager </h4>
<dd> A utility to calculate a time-step based on a 
desired "rate-of-change" in variables of user choice. Several
methods of calculating a rate-of-change norm are provided, as
well as means to force and limit the recommended time-step. 
<p>

<dt> <h4>  XM - Expression Template Engine </h4>
<dd> Glommable expression template services.
Used to easily provide expressions (+,-, *,etc.) 
to any container class.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Units  </h4>
<dd> A set of utilities that provide for the conversion of various
quantities from one system of units to another. Also defines
useful physical constants such as electron rest mass, speed of
light, etc., etc. 
<p>


<dt> <h4>  Radphys </h4>
<dd> Provides radiation physics utilities for calculation of
Planck and Rosseland functions, electron-ion coupling coefficients,
thermal conduction coefficients, and various other radiation related
quantities.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Traits </h4>
<dd> Provides container traits such as iterator, const_iterator, and
conformal for integers, doubles, and STL vectors.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  NML - Namelist I/O utility </h4>
<dd>
<p>

<dt> <h4>  RNG - Random Number Generator </h4>
<dd> Provides a type-safe wrapper to the SPRNG parallel random number
generator utility. 
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Diffusion </h4>
<dd> A diffusion solver package.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  IMC - Implicit Monte Carlo Utilities </h4>
<dd> Provides mesh-templated classes for thermal radiation transport
using implicit Monte-Carlo. Included are parallel communicators for
transporting particles across domain boundaries. 
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Linalg - Linear Algebra Utilities </h4>
<dd> Provides a type-safe wrapper to the PCGLib parallel conjugate
gradient linear solver package.
<p>


<dt> <h4>  P1Diffusion </h4>
<dd> A P1 solver package.
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Elisp </h4>
<dd> Provides an Xemacs/Elisp based code development environment for Draco.
Includes templates that contain header and format information and 
defines a set of modes and functions to both
expedite and homogenize code and document production. 
<p>

<dt> <h4>  Draco Build System </h4>
<dd> Provides a gm4/autoconf/gmake based build system for Draco. Supports
package addition within Draco, enforces levelized design, and provides
a template for creation of new Draco-like systems.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Test Problem Library </h4>
<dd> Provides a library of a variety of test problems for use
in validating code performance. These problems are  internally
consistent and well defined. They include results suitable for
benchmark comparison with any code capable of running the problem.
Problems are defined in the Python scripting language to provide
unambiguous results.
<p>


<dt> <h4> Fourier </h4>
<dd> Provides a set of Fourier analysis tools for analyzing the
convergence properties of various iterative acceleration schemes.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Viz </h4>
<dd> Provides a utility to dump mesh and solution data in a file format
suitable for reading by the Ensight visualization program.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Stop Watch </h4>
<dd> Provides a utility to aid in the timing and performance
analysis of all or parts of a client program.
