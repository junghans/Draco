Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Scientific programming in <TT>C++</TT> is subject to many of the same issues
that face scientific programming in Fortran (or any other language for
that matter).  Researchers must design and implement algorithms, data
structures, and even code architectures in <TT>C++</TT> just as in Fortran or
any other language.  There is one noteworthy difference however,
between developing scientific programs in <TT>C++</TT>, as compared to Fortran,
and that is the difficulty of utilizing prewritten scientific
subroutine libraries.  In Fortran or C, you can for the most part,
just call the subroutine that does what you want, from the library
that provides it.  In <TT>C++</TT> you are rarely so fortunate.  Why is this?
Because Fortran and C have uniform conventions for representing
numeric arrays, whereas in <TT>C++</TT> there are almost as many numeric
container classes as there are programmers.  If the subroutine you
want to call expects to receive data in a <TT>Vector</TT>, but what you
have is a <TT>Array&lt;double,1&gt;</TT>, you have a show stopping type
mismatch on your hands.

<P>
Thus we see that Fortran has succeeded in supporting reusable
software in a very limited way.  The fact that Fortran admitted only
one container type was ironically the key to this limited form of
reuse.  The writers of leaf routines, such as those in LAPACK or
other similar libraries, were free to assume a particular layout for
input data since it was practically inconceivable that the client code 
would store it any other way.  However this degree of interoperability 
was little solace to the application developer who needed to construct 
more sophisticated data structures.

<P>
In contrast, the profusion of container classes in <TT>C++</TT> is a fact of
life.  Unfortunately it has had a profound effect on the scientific
<TT>C++</TT> community, since historically it has functioned as a primary
impediment to the reuse of previously written software.  Any attempt
to produce a specification for a ``standard numeric container'' seems
to be futile, and it was recognition of this that led to the
development of ``glommable expression templates'' that could be easily
attached to existing numeric container classes [<A
 HREF="node10.html#Furnish97">1</A>].

<P>
In that prior article, I argued that the copious supply of different
numeric container classes in use in <TT>C++</TT> projects worldwide was
centrally responsible for impeding the reuse of scientific <TT>C++</TT> code,
and that it was necessary to have a container independent
implementation of expression templates
[<A
 HREF="node10.html#Veldhuizen95b">8</A>,<A
 HREF="node10.html#Veldhuizen96">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node10.html#Haney96">2</A>]
if they were to achieve widespread utilization.  In this article we
will explore ways to express other types of scientific subroutines in
a way that is also independent of the specific numeric container class
that may be employed in a given project.  Source code to accompany
this article is available at <TT>http://www.aip.org/cip/source.htm</TT>.
