<ul>

<li> 24 May 99 - Texas A&M graduate student 
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/fonelink.pl/149991">
<em> Daryl Hawkins</em> </a> arrives for the summer to participate
in the LANL GRA program.  Daryl
will be working in Draco on the <a href="../tycho/index.html"> Tycho </a>
transport project. He will be here through 20 Aug 99. Welcome Daryl!
<p>

<li> 17 May 99 - The well known
Object-Oriented Design authority <em> Norman L. Kerth </em> will
meet with the Draco team in June. Although plans are still under
discussion, we anticipate that he will conduct OO design
seminars and be available for individual discussions.
<p>

<li> 28 Apr 99 - Draco team members John McGhee and Randy Roberts
will attend Gerald Weinberg's next <em> "Problem Solving Leadership" </em>
workshop, to be held in Albuquerque, NM 14-19 Jun 99.
<p>

<li> 16 Mar 99 - Draco team members John McGhee, Shawn Pautz, and 
Randy Roberts will attend the project management
course "Mastering Projects Workshop" given by True North pgs, Inc. at
LANL on 6-8 Apr 99.
<p>

<li> 10 Mar 99 - Draco was reviewed by the X-Division External Review
Committee (XDERC) as part of their UC directed annual review of LANL X-Div.
<p>

<li> 22 Feb 99 - Renowned software-engineering expert <em> Gerald Weinberg </em>
will conduct a seminar for Draco on "Conducting Technical Reviews". This
seminar will provide a much needed boost for the Draco technical review
process.
<p>

<li> 8 Feb 99 - Draco team members will consult with Amy Schwab of 
True North pgs, Inc. a project guidance consulting firm. Discussion will
center on Draco project planning strategies.

 "Shadow-Object Interface Between Fortran 95 and C++", 
  <em> Computing in Science and Engineering, </em> 
Vol. 1, No. 2, Mar/Apr 99, pp 63-70.

<p>
<li> 1 Feb 99 - The definition of the Draco "MT" or mesh-type concept is 
being recast in terms of the C++ Standard Template Library by Draco Team member
Shawn Pautz. This will provide an important new standard for the
description of the MT concept, an idea central to the design of
much of the software in Draco.
<p>
<li> 1 Feb 99 - Julian Cummings of the LANL POOMA team is building
a POOMA based MT (mesh-type) for use in the Draco peer client Solon,
an orthogonal grid radiation diffusion code project.
<p>
<li> 25 Jan 99 - LANL X-HM group member Rob Lowrie is planning to utilize
Draco services to collaborate on a joint X-HM/X-TM radiation
hydrodynamics code project. We look forward to collaborating with
Rob on this interesting project.
<p>
<li> 19 Jan 99 - Draco software-engineering practices will be 
    reviewed by nationally renowned software-engineering
   expert <em> Edward Yourdan </em>.

<li> 15 Jan 99 - Draco will be reviewed by the Tri-Lab Software
Quality Practices Team. The team will conduct a "Software Process
Assessment" for Draco in the month of Feb. Managers will be interviewed on
9 Feb, and team-members on the 16'th. 
<p>
<li> 1 Jan 99 - The Draco makefile-based build system is undergoing
a extensive  revamp under the direction of Draco team members
Tom Evans and Randy Roberts. The new build system will provide for
