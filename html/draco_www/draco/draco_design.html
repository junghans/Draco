<h3> <center> Software Engineering Practices and Standards</center> </h3>

Draco utilizes
a variety of modern software
engineering techniques to enhance the quality of both its own components
 and its client systems. These techniques are integrated and applied
in Draco through a 
<a href="./se_process.html" > Software Engineering Process </a>.
An extensive discussion of
all of these techniques is beyond the scope of this page.
However, some of the more significant techniques are highlighted
below, along with links to more detailed information. 
<dl>

<dt> <h4> Levelized Design </h4>
<dd> Draco is composed of individual modules that can be
independently tested. More complex structures are assembled
from previously tested components with known performance. These
structures are in turn used to build other structures in a
hierarchical fashion. This type of design greatly facilitates
testing and debug of new products. Levelized design is discussed in
<a href="http://www.awl-he.com/titles/91568.html">
"Large Scale C++ Software Design" </a>, 
Lakos, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63362-0. 
A line-diagram depicting the current Draco design levels is available 
<a href="./images/draco_levels.gif" width=951 height=470> here </a>. The
modules themselves are described on the Draco <a href="./components.html"> 
component library </a> page.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Assertions and Design-by-Contract </h4>
<dd> Draco uses a built in assertion facility to verify the accuracy of
code results at interfaces to all functions and subroutines. Literally
millions of internal self-consistency checks are performed every
time the code runs, and an immediate halt occurs if any of these
checks fail. These checks cost nothing to the user, as they can
be disabled for optimum performance, if desired. Assertions are discussed
as one of the key features of 
<a href="http://www.eiffel.com/doc/manuals/technology/contract/" > 
Design-by-Contract</a> on the Eiffel home page. 
In addition to these references X-TM group member
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/fonelink.pl/114795">Mark Gray</a> has also
prepared a short <a href="./talk/talk.html"> 
introduction </a> to Design-by-Contract.
<p>

<dt> <h4>DejaGnu Testing Framework </h4>
<dd> A significant fraction of code found in the Draco system is
devoted to testing individual modules. This test code is automatically
driven by the 
<a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena.mit.edu/project/gnu/doc/html/dejagnu_toc.html"> DejaGnu </a> Testing Framework. As part
of the DejaGnu driven test program, Draco utilizes
an advanced test methodology designed to demonstrate the ability
to accurately solve certain analytic test problems. 
<p>

<dt> <h4> Generic Programming </h4>
<dd>Generic programming is a means of providing an unprecedented degree
of flexibility in reusable software. The user provides a "template"
and the library code morphs to fit the template at compile time.
The C++ Standard Template Library is the 
current most widely known example of generic programming.
A recent book, 

<a href="./references.html#GP&STL" >
<em> Generic Programming and the STL </em> </a>,

describes the STL and the principles behind it.
These principles are also discussed in an
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/drdobbs-interview.html" >
interview </a>
with Alexander Stepanov, the developer of the C++ STL.
Further discussion can be found at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
<a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/gp/index.html" > Generic Programming
Project </a> page. In addition to these references, X-TM group member 
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/fonelink.pl/114795">Mark Gray</a> has also
prepared a short 
<a href="./framework/framework.html"> introduction </a> to generic programming.
Also of interest is 
<a href="./cip/cip.html">"Container-Free Numerical Algorithms in C++"</a>,
           <em>Computers in Physics, </em>
           Vol. 12, No. 3, May/Jun 98,
by former X-TM group member 
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/fonelink.pl/121201">Geoff Furnish</a>.

<p> 
<dt> <h4> C++ and Object Oriented Design </h4>
<dd> Draco uses modern object oriented design principles to facilitate reuse,
extendibility, and maintainability of all its components. The primary
implementation language is C++. Numerous references on C++ and
object oriented design can be found on the Draco
<a href="./references.html"> References </a> page.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Technical Review </h4>
<dd> The work of all authors contributions to Draco is
subject to formal technical review by members of group X-TM
and outside consultants. 
<p>

<dt> <h4> Documentation </h4>
<dd> Documentation is developed and included in Draco as an integral
part of the project. Documentation products are stored
under CVS control together with the relevant source and test code.
Draco provides LaTeX templates for creation of memos, technical notes
and other products.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Revision Control </h4>
<dd> Draco is maintained and developed under the GNU
<a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena.mit.edu/project/
gnu/doc/html/cvs_1.html" > CVS </a>
version control system. Version control is
widely recognized as a fundamental requisite for modern code development.
Draco and Draco package numbered releases are accessed through
the CVS tag utility. Release policy and procedures are described in the
<a href="./procedures.html" > <em> Draco Release Policy and Procedures</em>
</a> document.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Makefile Build System </h4>
<dd>Draco uses a locally developed, GNU make based makefile 
system that provides
virtually instant portability to any standard Unix platform.
As an added benefit, this system also enforces a levelized
physical design (as discussed above) on the whole Draco system,
and provides for the simultaneous construction of optimized
and debug executable versions. 
<p>

<dt> <h4> Purify </h4>
<dd> <a href="http://www.rational.com/products/purify_unix/"> Purify </a>
is an industry standard run-time
memory-leak and error detection utility. All Draco code is 
checked with Purify prior to release.
<p>

<dt> <h4> Context Sensitive Editing </h4>
<dd> As numerous industry consultants have confirmed, a context
sensitive editor is one of the most useful tools available
for early error detection in the code development process. All
Draco code development is undertaken with context sensitive
editors. The majority of coding is done using the Gnu emacs or 
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org">Xemacs</a> editors.

<p>
<dt> <h4> Defect Tracking </h4>
<dd> Accurate and reliable tracking of defects detected both
during development and post-release is well known to 
be critical to the software quality control process. Draco
uses the Gnu 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/gnats/"> Gnats </a>
defect tracking system for this purpose.
