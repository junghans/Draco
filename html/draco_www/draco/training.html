<h3> <center> New Developer Training Program </center> </h3>

This page provides a training program  outline for new Draco 
developers. It is anticipated that each individual will 
require training in a variety of areas. The lists below are
not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to
document the basic skills that new developers should acquire
to prepare themselves to contribute to Draco.
For those who wish to explore further, many additional
references are provided on the Draco 
<a href="http:./references.html" > References </a> page. Documents
referenced below with "DDN" numbers can be found  on the Draco
<a href="http:./procedures.html" > Procedures Archive </a> page.
Lastly,
perhaps the most important resource for new developers is
the current Draco developers themselves.

<h4> C++ Programming Skills </h4>
The language of choice for Draco code development is C++. Draco also
uses the concepts of Object-Oriented Design  and Generic Programming
extensively. The references below provide an introduction to these
concepts.
<ul>
  <li> <em> How to Program C++, 2nd Edition </em>,
        Deitel and Deitel, Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-528910-6. This book
        provides a good introduction to C++ syntax for the beginner, as
        well as an introduction to more advanced concepts.
  <li> <em>Large Scale C++ Software Design,</em> Lakos, Addison-Wesley,
        ISBN 0-201-63362-0. Explains the fundamental principles used
        in the design and construction of large C++ software projects.
  <li> <em> Generic Programming and the STL </a> </em>, 
       Austern, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-30956-4. Provides insight
       into the ideas behind generic programming.
</ul>

<h4> Code Development Environment </h4>
<ul>
<li> Emacs and XEmacs - The Draco code development environment
is based on the most popular editor in the UNIX world today: Emacs.
Numerous templates and functions are provided in the Draco
elisp library. See DDN 99-?? Evans, "XEmacs Development Environment
for Draco" for setup and use instructions. The book
 <em> Learning GNU Emacs,</em> Cameron and Rosenblatt,
               O'Reilly and Associates, Inc. ISBN 0-937175-84-6, is 
 a classic Emacs reference. The
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/" > XEmacs</a> home page
provides links to XEmacs documentation. 
<li> CVS - Access to all Draco code is controlled through the
     CVS version control system. In order to contribute to the
     Draco repository, a familiarity with basic CVS commands such
     as "cvs checkout" and "cvs commit" is
     required. An online manual for CVS can be viewed at the GNU
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/manual/cvs/" > CVS </a> 
     site.
</ul>

<h4> Document Preparation </h4>
Documents in Draco are produced using the LaTeX document
preparation system. There are many useful LaTeX templates included
in the Draco elisp library. 
<em> A Guide to LaTeX2e, Second Edition, </em> Kopka and Daly, 
Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-42777, is a useful reference on 
LaTeX fundamentals. 
</ul>

<h4> Object Oriented Design  Tools </h4>

All new coding efforts for the Draco repository are 
required to produce a design document. The design
language is the Unified Modeling Language (UML). 
The <em> UML User Guide,</em> Booch, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-57168-4
provides an introduction to the UML. 
The Draco team is currently using the 
<a href="http://www.rational.com/products/rose/index.jtmpl" > 
            Rational Rose </a> visual modeling tool for software
            design and development.
Manuals are available from Draco team members. 
Although new users will not normally be expected to act as 
code architects, Draco encourages all apprentice developers
to develop design skills for the long term, and to be able
to read and understand design documents produced by other 
team memebers.

<h4> Transport Fundamentals </h4>
For those who may be unfamiliar with transport theory, 
<em> Computational Methods of Neutron Transport </em>, Lewis and Miller,
Wiley-Interscience, ISBN 0-471-09245-2 is the classic reference.

<h4> Build System </h4>
The Draco build system is a GNU make based system that
uses gm4 and autoconf.
Extensive knowledge of the design and function of the build system
is not a prerequisite to working in Draco, however those who
may wish to extend or modify the build system may find DDN-??
"The Draco Build System" Evans and Roberts of interest. References
to online manuals for gmake, gm4 and autoconf can be found on 
the Draco <a href="./links.html" > Links </a>  page.

<h4> Python </h4>
At present only a small amount of Draco is written in Python.
<em> Learning Python, </em> Lutz and Ascher, 
                    O'Reilly & Associates, ISBN 1-56592-464-9,
provides a good introduction to the language.
The 
<a href="http://www.python.org/" > Python </a>  home page has
links to other current info.

<h4> Project Management </h4>

A good starting point for small-project software engineering principles is
available in:
<em> <a href="http://www.construx.com/survivalguide/">
                    Software Project Survival Guide,</a></em> McConnell, 
                    Microsoft Press, ISBN 1-57231-621-7.
