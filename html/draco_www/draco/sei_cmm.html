<h3> <center> Software Capability Maturity Model </center> </h3>

The <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu" > Software Engineering Institute </a> at Carnegie
Mellon University has produced a widely recognized "Capability
Maturity Model for Software" (SEI-CMM). A 
<a
href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/publications/documents/96.reports/96.ar.cmm.v1.1.html" 
> document </a> describing this model
is available on-line from the SEI. The purpose of the model is to provide
organizations an effective means of improving their software engineering
processes. This model is based on knowledge acquired from years of software process
assessments and extensive feedback from industry and government.
In the sections below we briefly describe the model and the current
status of the Draco project within it.

<h3> CMM Levels </h3>
The SEI-CMM categorizes organizations into five different CMM "levels".
As an organization's software process improves over time, the organization
advances sequentially from level one to level five. Each level provides the
foundation to proceed to the next level. It is not considered advisable to
try to skip levels. Within each level, the model identifies "Key Process Areas"
or KPA's. In order to be considered at a certain CMM level, the goals of
the all the KPA's at that level must be satisfied. The levels and KPA's are
listed below:
<p>
<ul>

<li> <strong> CMM Maturity Level One (Initial)  </strong>
  <ul>
    <li> No process in evidence.
    <li> Ad hoc, chaotic, few processes defined, success
         depends on individual heroic effort.
    <li> This is the entry level rating that all organizations initially receive. It 
         contains no KPA's, and merely provides a starting point for the rating
         system.
  </ul>
<p>
<li> <strong> CMM Maturity Level Two (Repeatable) </strong>
  <ul>
    <li> A disciplined process. 
    <li> Basic project management processes are established
         to track  cost, schedule, functionality. Enough process in place to
         reliably repeat earlier successes.
    <li> Key Process Areas:
      <ul>
       <li> KPA 2.1 Software Configuration Management
       <li> KPA 2.2 Software Quality Assurance
       <li> KPA 2.3 Software Subcontract Management
       <li> KPA 2.4 Software Project Tracking and Over-site
       <li> KPA 2.5 Software Project Planning
       <li> KPA 2.6 Requirements Management
      </ul>
  </ul>
<p>
<li> <strong> CMM Maturity Level Three (Defined) </strong>
   <ul>
    <li> A standard, consistent process. 
    <li> The software process for both management and
         engineering is documented, standardized,  and integrated into
         a standard software process. 
    <li> Key Process Areas:
      <ul>
      <li> KPA 3.1 Peer Reviews
      <li> KPA 3.2 Intergroup Coordination
      <li> KPA 3.3 Software Product Engineering
      <li> KPA 3.4 Integrated Software Management
      <li> KPA 3.5 Training Program
      <li> KPA 3.6 Organization Process Definition
      <li> KPA 3.7 Organization Process Focus
     </ul>
   </ul>
<p>
<li> <strong> CMM Maturity Level Four (Managed) </strong>
  <ul>
    <li> A predictable process. 
    <li> Detailed measures of software process and
         product quality are collected. Both the software process
         and products are quantitatively understood and controlled.
    <li> Key Process Areas
    <ul>
      <li> KPA 4.1 Software Quality Management
      <li> KPA 4.2 Quantitative Process Management
    </ul>
  </ul>
<p>
<li> <strong> CMM Maturity Level Five (Optimized) </strong>
  <ul>
   <li> A continuously improving process.
   <li> Continuous process improvement enabled by
        quantitative feedback from the process and from piloting 
        innovative ideas and technologies.
   <li>  Key Process Areas
   <ul>
     <li> KPA 5.1 Process Change Management
     <li> KPA 5.2 Technology Change Management
     <li> KPA 5.3 Defect Prevention
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
