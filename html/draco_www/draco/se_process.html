<h3> <center> Software Engineering Process </center> </h3>

This page describes the Draco software engineering process and
associated software development plans and standards. 
The purpose of these plans is to describe the activities
to be performed on all Draco software projects. These activities
include development and maintenance tasks such as
requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, quality control,
and documentation.

<h3> Background and Current Status </h3>
Draco is a small (< 10 people) software development team.
Many parts of our current process are
informal and ad hoc.
We are committed to improving our software engineering process and 
to advancing our <a href="./sei_cmm.html" > SEI-CMM rating </a>. 
We are examining several software engineering  processes and
are attempting to incorporate the principles obtained thereby
into our daily operation. 
Some of the  processes under consideration include:
  <ul>
   <li> "Zero'th Order Measurement",
        Part V of Quality Software Management Vol 2, Gerald Weinberg
   <li> <a href="http://www.construx.com/survivalguide/" > 
        Software Project Survival Guide </a>, Steve McConnell
   <li> <a href="http://sel.gsfc.nasa.gov/doc-st/docs.htm" >
          Recommended Approach to Software Development </a>,  
         NASA Software Engineering Laboratory
  </ul>
We are also obtaining advice and reviews
from recognized authorities in the software-engineering field, as well as
attending seminars and short-courses. Some of our recent activities
in this regard are listed on the Draco <a href="./news.html" >
Current Events </a> page.
Draco team member Mark Gray has created a LaTeX form for 
evaluating the SEI-CMM <a href="./sei_cmm.html" > Key Process Areas </a>, 
and we will be using
this form to perform periodic self-assessments. The information
below provides an overview of some of the most significant  aspects of our 
current program.


<h3> Technical Review </h3>
A key component in the Draco software-engineering process is the
technical review. The process of peer review provides numerous
benefits for both for the reviewer and the reviewed.
The <em> Handbook of Walkthroughs, Inspections and 
Technical Reviews </em> by  Freedman and Weinberg, Dorset
         House is a useful reference for conducting technical 
reviews.


<h3> Software Life Cycle </h3>
The Draco software-engineering process is based on
a software development life-cycle which we consider to consist of
the following phases:
<ul>
<li> Requirements Gathering and Analysis
<li> Code Design
<li> Code Implementation
<li> Testing
<li> Maintenance
</ul>
The individual software development life cycle phases are discussed
below.

<h4> Requirements </h4>
All projects will have a requirements document which will be developed in
coordination with the project customer. This document will undergo
formal technical review. The document and the review will be
stored in the project CVS repository. After initial acceptance,
the project requirements will be reviewed
periodically to access their continuing accuracy and completeness.
<em> Exploring Requirements - Quality before Design </em> by 
Gause and Weinberg, Dorset House, provides a useful reference on
generating requirements documents. A risk analysis should be
performed as part of the requirements task. 

<h4> Code Design </h4>
All projects will have a design that can be shown to satisfy the requirements
specified in the
requirements document.  Project designs will be object-oriented and
utilize Design-by-Contract (DBC). Generic designs based on the theme
of the C++ STL are highly encouraged.
All designs will be testable and levelized. The principles of levelized design
are discussed in
<a href="http://www.awl-he.com/titles/91568.html">
"Large Scale C++ Software Design" </a>, 
Lakos, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-63362-0. 
There will be a design
document that describes the design. The design and its documentation
will undergo formal technical review. The design document and the review
will be stored in the project CVS repository.
A User's Manual, Technical Background document, and Testing Plan 
will be produced as part of the design task, and stored under
CVS control.  The design will be subject
to periodic review during the development process. 

<h4> Code Implementation </h4>
Code will be implemented according to the design. Code will be
written with a context-sensitive editor, and stored under CVS
control. Code will be tagged at appropriate points in the
course of development. There will be a formal
technical review of the code, and the results stored in the
project CVS repository. Test suites are expected to comprise
approximately 50% of the total code written.  Test suites will
be stored in the project repository together with 
the relevant source code. A capability will be
provided to automatically drive tests. Assertions will
be liberally used to confirm adherence to DBC requirements.
Liberal use of comments is required. A conventional coding style
will be consistently used throughout the project to enhance the
readability of the code. The preferred language is C++ or Python,
vigorous arguments are required to justify the use of other 
languages. Code will be compiled and linked under the control of
the Draco build system.

<h4> Testing </h4>
Component tests will be run nightly under automatic script control.
Insure++ will be run on all code. Testing must take place with
assertions enabled. If applicable, code will be validated 
using the Analytic-Test-Method (ATM) and by comparison with
any relevant analytic benchmarks. 

<h4> Maintenance </h4>
Bugs and deficiencies will be tracked during development and
post-release using the Gnats defect tracking system. Problems
will be assigned to a specific individual who will be responsible
for resolving the bug to the satisfaction of the interested parties.
Bug status will be periodically audited to assure adequate and
timely resolution of problems.


<h3> Project Planning and Tracking </h3>
Preliminary project planning can begin after project requirements are
identified. As more project details become available during the course
of the software life-cycle, project planning will 
continue in an on-going fashion.  The plan should provide for 
a staged delivery which will provide essential functionality in the first
release.
At the beginning of each stage of the project, more detailed plans should be
constructed for that stage. Plans should undergo technical review, be placed under
revision control, and subsequently reviewed and updated at regular intervals.
The <a href="http://www.construx.com/survivalguide/" > 
        <cite> Software Project Survival Guide, </cite> </a> by Steve McConnell
provides a useful reference for many of the aspects of project planning.
