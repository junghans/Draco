<h3> <center> System Overview </center> </h3>
<p>
The purpose of the Draco system is the creation
of a stable, well designed environment for radiation transport code development.
Software construction in such an environment results in  improved 
products, faster turnarounds, and better service for all of our customers.
<p>
In order to understand he philosophy behind the development of Draco
it is useful to begin by considering the historical X-6 operating environment.
Like many organizations,
group X-6 finds itself in a somewhat chaotic
operating environment, which
can be characterized
in part by the following observations:
<ul>
<li> We must be responsive to customer requirements.
<li> We have a multitude of customers, all demanding top quality
   products delivered in a timely fashion.
<li> Each of our customers has different operating requirements,
   data structure requirements, and in general their "own
   way of doing things".
<li> The individual lifetime of any of our customers is
   completely unpredictable.
<li> Customer requirements are often unclear and 
   have a tendency to change with little or no notification.
</ul>
<p>
In the past, X-6 has functioned in this environment by addressing
each customers requirements in a "one-off" fashion, effectively
creating a custom package from the ground up for each project.
Usually, there were only one or two people involved with a
project, and when their expertise was no longer available, the
understanding of the inner workings of a project was often lost. Moreover,
when a customer disappeared, all the work done for that project was 
effectively lost. As a result, each new project started from scratch,
reuse was minimal, and development times were long, reducing the
amount of time available for testing, optimization, and evaluation
of advanced concepts and techniques.
The Draco system attempts to provide a more effective means
of operation than the one described above. 
<p>
Simply stated, Draco is designed to create a stable, well thought
out, well designed environment for radiation transport code development,
which simultaneously provides the flexibility to meet widely
varying customer requirements.
Draco provides a buffer between the chaotic outside world and X-6,
creating a local environment conducive to predictable development schedules,
reuse, the production of high quality algorithms,  complete testing,
and rapid response to the needs of the individual customer. 

<p>
One of the more significant features Draco employs to accomplish this goal is a
"services library" of high quality,
portable, reusable code. Software components common to
multiple transport projects are abstracted and placed
in the library. New projects can then be assembled in large
part using pre-developed and tested off-the-shelf components.
Such components include:
<ul>
<li> Communication libraries
<li> Assertion facilities
<li> Quadrature libraries
<li> I/O interfaces
<li> Common mesh formats and problem descriptions
<li> Source, initial condition, and edit facilities
<li> Material properties specifications
<li> A variety of diffusion and transport solvers
<li> Supporting linear-algebra and mathematical function
routines
<li> A common testing framework and library of test problems
</ul>
and others.
<p>
In many ways, the Draco System can be considered as the foundation of
a "product line" in the software-engineering sense. A product line is
"a group of products sharing a common, managed set of features 
that satisfy the needs of a selected market or mission area."
Product lines are emerging as an important approach to holding 
down the costs and reducing the time to market of complex software products.
