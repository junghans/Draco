<h3> <center> Methods Development Environment </center> </h3>

This page provides an overview of the methods development
environment associated with the Draco CPS.
 Draco developers generally
consider themselves to be <em> "computational physicists" </em> with 
a detailed knowledge of the physics of radiation transport, as well as
knowledge of numerical methods and modern software engineering techniques.
The list below presents some of the major features of the
software engineering environment that Draco developers work
in on a daily basis. This list is not exhaustive, but is intended to
give a general idea of some of the concepts in use
in the Draco project. Many of
these concepts are discussed more fully elsewhere on this site.
