	* draco_regression: Replace environment setup with a calls to
	  /usr/local/lf9560/bash_setup, draco/regression/parse_options,
	  etc.  After environment setup, echo the environment to the log
	  file by calling the script draco/regression/echo_env.  Remove
	  lampi_dbg build from target_list. Replace hard coded "draco"
	  strings with a variable so that this regression script can be
	  used as a template for other projects.  Remove explicity vendor
	  directory setup - these are now set in .bashrc.  Added
	  functionality for "-n" option -- that is, only echo the commands
	  -- do not execute them.
