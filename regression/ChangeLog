	* draco_regression (make_regression_directories): Changed the way
	  the script works when the coverage option is turned on.  The
	  script will run the unit test suite for scalar and mpi mode
	  before coverage statistics are compiled. Also, configure user
	  environment so that the coverage tool works correctly.  This
	  last option required that a variable MAKE_OPTIONS be defined for
	  each type of regression target.  Added postprocessing script for
	  generating the coverage reports.

	* covclass.cfg: Added this coverage configuration file.  It is
	  used to tell Bullseye what sources should be omitted from the
	  coverage analsysis {source found in test directories, headers
	  from the install location and 3rd party headers are omitted}.

	* draco_regression: Replace environment setup with a calls to
	  /usr/local/lf9560/bash_setup, draco/regression/parse_options,
	  etc.  After environment setup, echo the environment to the log
	  file by calling the script draco/regression/echo_env.  Remove
	  lampi_dbg build from target_list. Replace hard coded "draco"
	  strings with a variable so that this regression script can be
	  used as a template for other projects.  Remove explicity vendor
	  directory setup - these are now set in .bashrc.  Added
	  functionality for "-n" option -- that is, only echo the commands
	  - do not execute them.
