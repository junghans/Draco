	* launch: Add a capability to time regression run times.

	* launch: Add checks for interactive or cron job.  If this is an
	  interactive job, send extra info to tty and do not send final
	  email report.

	* launch: Add logic to determine the value of $REGHOME
	  (/home/regress or /usr/projects/draco/regress).

	* launch: Simplify the script used to compile and email the final
	  report. 

	* parse_options (set_default_values): Replace hard coded value for
	  ${regress_home} with logic to determine what value it should
	  have.  If username == regress, set it to /home/regress.

	* parse_options (set_default_values): Add commands to augment
	  $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that the regression scripts can
	  find gcc-3.4.2, xmgrace and ghostview.

	* parse_options (parse_options): Add new option --with-source that
	  tells the regression script where the source code is.  This
	  option disables automatic cvs checkout of source code.

	* draco_regression: Replace environment setup with a calls to
	/usr/local/lf9560/bash_setup, draco/regression/parse_options,
	etc.  After environment setup, echo the environment to the log
	file by calling the script draco/regression/echo_env.  Remove
	lampi_dbg build from target_list. Replace hard coded "draco"
	strings with a variable so that this regression script can be used
	as a template for other projects.  Remove explicity vendor
	directory setup - these are now set in .bashrc.  Added
	functionality for "-n" option -- that is, only echo the commands -
	do not execute them.
